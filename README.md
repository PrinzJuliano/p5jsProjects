This are usually stupid but sometimes very clever snippets that I share with you.

If you find any additions, code redundancies, or generally optimisations please fork and request a merge.

If you find any bugs please open a ticket under [Issues](https://github.com/PrinzJuliano/p5jsProjects/issues)

You can use this code to enhance yours.
