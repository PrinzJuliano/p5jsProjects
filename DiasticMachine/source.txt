ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

    FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO 

BERNARDO

    Who's there?

FRANCISCO

    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO

    Long live the king!

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo?

BERNARDO

    He.

FRANCISCO

    You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO

    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO

    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO

    Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO

    Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO

    Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO

    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO

    Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS

    And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO

    Give you good night.

MARCELLUS

    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Who hath relieved you?

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo has my place.
    Give you good night.

    Exit

MARCELLUS

    Holla! Bernardo!

BERNARDO

    Say,
    What, is Horatio there?

HORATIO

    A piece of him.

BERNARDO

    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

BERNARDO

    I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS

    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    That if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

HORATIO

    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

BERNARDO

    Sit down awhile;
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story
    What we have two nights seen.

HORATIO

    Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

BERNARDO

    Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one,--

    Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS

    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

BERNARDO

    In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

MARCELLUS

    Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

BERNARDO

    Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

HORATIO

    Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

BERNARDO

    It would be spoke to.

MARCELLUS

    Question it, Horatio.

HORATIO

    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

MARCELLUS

    It is offended.

BERNARDO

    See, it stalks away!

HORATIO

    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

    Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS

    'Tis gone, and will not answer.

BERNARDO

    How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?

HORATIO

    Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.

MARCELLUS

    Is it not like the king?

HORATIO

    As thou art to thyself:
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.

MARCELLUS

    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

HORATIO

    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

MARCELLUS

    Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    Who is't that can inform me?

HORATIO

    That can I;
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

BERNARDO

    I think it be no other but e'en so:
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
    That was and is the question of these wars.

HORATIO

    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

    Re-enter Ghost
    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me:
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    Speak to me:

    Cock crows
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

HORATIO

    Do, if it will not stand.

BERNARDO

    'Tis here!

HORATIO

    'Tis here!

MARCELLUS

    'Tis gone!

    Exit Ghost
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.

BERNARDO

    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

HORATIO

    And then it started like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.

MARCELLUS

    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

HORATIO

    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

MARCELLUS

    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants 

KING CLAUDIUS

    Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the king, more than the scope
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND

    In that and all things will we show our duty.

KING CLAUDIUS

    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

LAERTES

    My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

LORD POLONIUS

    He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--

HAMLET

    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

HAMLET

    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.

HAMLET

    Ay, madam, it is common.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?

HAMLET

    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

KING CLAUDIUS

    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    But, you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    For what we know must be and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd: whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire:
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

HAMLET

    I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

    Exeunt all but HAMLET

HAMLET

    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
    O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
    Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules: within a month:
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not nor it cannot come to good:
    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

    Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO

HORATIO

    Hail to your lordship!

HAMLET

    I am glad to see you well:
    Horatio,--or I do forget myself.

HORATIO

    The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

HAMLET

    Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?

MARCELLUS

    My good lord--

HAMLET

    I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

HORATIO

    A truant disposition, good my lord.

HAMLET

    I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

HORATIO

    My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

HAMLET

    I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

HORATIO

    Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

HAMLET

    Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father!--methinks I see my father.

HORATIO

    Where, my lord?

HAMLET

    In my mind's eye, Horatio.

HORATIO

    I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

HAMLET

    He was a man, take him for all in all,
    I shall not look upon his like again.

HORATIO

    My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

HAMLET

    Saw? who?

HORATIO

    My lord, the king your father.

HAMLET

    The king my father!

HORATIO

    Season your admiration for awhile
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.

HAMLET

    For God's love, let me hear.

HORATIO

    Two nights together had these gentlemen,
    Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
    In the dead vast and middle of the night,
    Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them, and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes: I knew your father;
    These hands are not more like.

HAMLET

    But where was this?

MARCELLUS

    My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

HAMLET

    Did you not speak to it?

HORATIO

    My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none: yet once methought
    It lifted up its head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
    And vanish'd from our sight.

HAMLET

    'Tis very strange.

HORATIO

    As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.

HAMLET

    Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    We do, my lord.

HAMLET

    Arm'd, say you?

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    Arm'd, my lord.

HAMLET

    From top to toe?

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    My lord, from head to foot.

HAMLET

    Then saw you not his face?

HORATIO

    O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

HAMLET

    What, look'd he frowningly?

HORATIO

    A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

HAMLET

    Pale or red?

HORATIO

    Nay, very pale.

HAMLET

    And fix'd his eyes upon you?

HORATIO

    Most constantly.

HAMLET

    I would I had been there.

HORATIO

    It would have much amazed you.

HAMLET

    Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

HORATIO

    While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    Longer, longer.

HORATIO

    Not when I saw't.

HAMLET

    His beard was grizzled--no?

HORATIO

    It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.

HAMLET

    I will watch to-night;
    Perchance 'twill walk again.

HORATIO

    I warrant it will.

HAMLET

    If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.

All

    Our duty to your honour.

HAMLET

    Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

    Exeunt all but HAMLET
    My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
    I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

    Exit

SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.

    Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA 

LAERTES

    My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.

OPHELIA

    Do you doubt that?

LAERTES

    For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.

OPHELIA

    No more but so?

LAERTES

    Think it no more;
    For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth:
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state;
    And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmaster'd importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    The canker galls the infants of the spring,
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

OPHELIA

    I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    And recks not his own rede.

LAERTES

    O, fear me not.
    I stay too long: but here my father comes.

    Enter POLONIUS
    A double blessing is a double grace,
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

LORD POLONIUS

    Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
    Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all: to thine ownself be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

LAERTES

    Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    The time invites you; go; your servants tend.

LAERTES

    Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
    What I have said to you.

OPHELIA

    'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

LAERTES

    Farewell.

    Exit

LORD POLONIUS

    What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?

OPHELIA

    So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, well bethought:
    'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you; and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
    If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? give me up the truth.

OPHELIA

    He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.

LORD POLONIUS

    Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

OPHELIA

    I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
    Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.

OPHELIA

    My lord, he hath importuned me with love
    In honourable fashion.

LORD POLONIUS

    Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

OPHELIA

    And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

LORD POLONIUS

    Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
    Have you so slander any moment leisure,
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.

OPHELIA

    I shall obey, my lord.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The platform.

    Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS 

HAMLET

    The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

HORATIO

    It is a nipping and an eager air.

HAMLET

    What hour now?

HORATIO

    I think it lacks of twelve.

HAMLET

    No, it is struck.

HORATIO

    Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

    A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
    What does this mean, my lord?

HAMLET

    The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.

HORATIO

    Is it a custom?

HAMLET

    Ay, marry, is't:
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
    They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So, oft it chances in particular men,
    That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin--
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men,
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
    Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo--
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault: the dram of eale
    Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
    To his own scandal.

HORATIO

    Look, my lord, it comes!

    Enter Ghost

HAMLET

    Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou comest in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
    Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?

    Ghost beckons HAMLET

HORATIO

    It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.

MARCELLUS

    Look, with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground:
    But do not go with it.

HORATIO

    No, by no means.

HAMLET

    It will not speak; then I will follow it.

HORATIO

    Do not, my lord.

HAMLET

    Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.

HORATIO

    What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other horrible form,
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? think of it:
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fathoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.

HAMLET

    It waves me still.
    Go on; I'll follow thee.

MARCELLUS

    You shall not go, my lord.

HAMLET

    Hold off your hands.

HORATIO

    Be ruled; you shall not go.

HAMLET

    My fate cries out,
    And makes each petty artery in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
    I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

    Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET

HORATIO

    He waxes desperate with imagination.

MARCELLUS

    Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

HORATIO

    Have after. To what issue will this come?

MARCELLUS

    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

HORATIO

    Heaven will direct it.

MARCELLUS

    Nay, let's follow him.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the platform.

    Enter GHOST and HAMLET 

HAMLET

    Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.

Ghost

    Mark me.

HAMLET

    I will.

Ghost

    My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.

HAMLET

    Alas, poor ghost!

Ghost

    Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.

HAMLET

    Speak; I am bound to hear.

Ghost

    So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

HAMLET

    What?

Ghost

    I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confined to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part
    And each particular hair to stand on end,
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love--

HAMLET

    O God!

Ghost

    Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

HAMLET

    Murder!

Ghost

    Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

HAMLET

    Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.

Ghost

    I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.

HAMLET

    O my prophetic soul! My uncle!

Ghost

    Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be moved,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
    And prey on garbage.
    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head:
    O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
    If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
    Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

    Exit

HAMLET

    O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
    And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
    That youth and observation copied there;
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:

    Writing
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
    I have sworn 't.

MARCELLUS HORATIO

    [Within] My lord, my lord,--

MARCELLUS

    [Within] Lord Hamlet,--

HORATIO

    [Within] Heaven secure him!

HAMLET

    So be it!

HORATIO

    [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

HAMLET

    Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.

    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

MARCELLUS

    How is't, my noble lord?

HORATIO

    What news, my lord?

HAMLET

    O, wonderful!

HORATIO

    Good my lord, tell it.

HAMLET

    No; you'll reveal it.

HORATIO

    Not I, my lord, by heaven.

MARCELLUS

    Nor I, my lord.

HAMLET

    How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?

HORATIO MARCELLUS

    Ay, by heaven, my lord.

HAMLET

    There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.

HORATIO

    There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.

HAMLET

    Why, right; you are i' the right;
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
    You, as your business and desire shall point you;
    For every man has business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.

HORATIO

    These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

HAMLET

    I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, 'faith heartily.

HORATIO

    There's no offence, my lord.

HAMLET

    Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.

HORATIO

    What is't, my lord? we will.

HAMLET

    Never make known what you have seen to-night.

HORATIO MARCELLUS

    My lord, we will not.

HAMLET

    Nay, but swear't.

HORATIO

    In faith,
    My lord, not I.

MARCELLUS

    Nor I, my lord, in faith.

HAMLET

    Upon my sword.

MARCELLUS

    We have sworn, my lord, already.

HAMLET

    Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
    truepenny?
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
    Consent to swear.

HORATIO

    Propose the oath, my lord.

HAMLET

    Never to speak of this that you have seen,
    Swear by my sword.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword:
    Never to speak of this that you have heard,
    Swear by my sword.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.

HORATIO

    O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

HAMLET

    And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
    As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on,
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me: this not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!

    They swear
    So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you:
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do, to express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.

    Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO 

LORD POLONIUS

    Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

REYNALDO

    I will, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before you visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behavior.

REYNALDO

    My lord, I did intend it.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
    Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it:
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?

REYNALDO

    Ay, very well, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
    But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
    Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.

REYNALDO

    As gaming, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing: you may go so far.

REYNALDO

    My lord, that would dishonour him.

LORD POLONIUS

    'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency;
    That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.

REYNALDO

    But, my good lord,--

LORD POLONIUS

    Wherefore should you do this?

REYNALDO

    Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, sir, here's my drift;
    And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
    You laying these slight sullies on my son,
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
    He closes with you in this consequence;
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country.

REYNALDO

    Very good, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
    about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
    something: where did I leave?

REYNALDO

    At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
    and 'gentleman.'

LORD POLONIUS

    At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
    I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
    Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
    There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now;
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out:
    So by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

REYNALDO

    My lord, I have.

LORD POLONIUS

    God be wi' you; fare you well.

REYNALDO

    Good my lord!

LORD POLONIUS

    Observe his inclination in yourself.

REYNALDO

    I shall, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    And let him ply his music.

REYNALDO

    Well, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    Farewell!

    Exit REYNALDO

    Enter OPHELIA
    How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

OPHELIA

    O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

LORD POLONIUS

    With what, i' the name of God?

OPHELIA

    My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
    No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
    Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
    Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.

LORD POLONIUS

    Mad for thy love?

OPHELIA

    My lord, I do not know;
    But truly, I do fear it.

LORD POLONIUS

    What said he?

OPHELIA

    He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
    And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
    For out o' doors he went without their helps,
    And, to the last, bended their light on me.

LORD POLONIUS

    Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?

OPHELIA

    No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
    I did repel his fetters and denied
    His access to me.

LORD POLONIUS

    That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
    And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might
    move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants 

KING CLAUDIUS

    Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
    Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from the understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time: so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile,
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Both your majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.

GUILDENSTERN

    But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

GUILDENSTERN

    Heavens make our presence and our practises
    Pleasant and helpful to him!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Ay, amen!

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants

    Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thou still hast been the father of good news.

LORD POLONIUS

    Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
    I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king:
    And I do think, or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath used to do, that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.

LORD POLONIUS

    Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

    Exit POLONIUS
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I doubt it is no other but the main;
    His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Well, we shall sift him.

    Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    Welcome, my good friends!
    Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?

VOLTIMAND

    Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
    But, better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
    That so his sickness, age and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack:
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,

    Giving a paper
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.

KING CLAUDIUS

    It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time well read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
    Most welcome home!

    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
    Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    More matter, with less art.

LORD POLONIUS

    Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause:
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
    I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
    Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.

    Reads
    'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
    beautified Ophelia,'--
    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
    a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:

    Reads
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Came this from Hamlet to her?

LORD POLONIUS

    Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.

    Reads
    'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
    Doubt that the sun doth move;
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
    But never doubt I love.
    'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
    I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
    I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
    'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
    this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means and place,
    All given to mine ear.

KING CLAUDIUS

    But how hath she
    Received his love?

LORD POLONIUS

    What do you think of me?

KING CLAUDIUS

    As of a man faithful and honourable.

LORD POLONIUS

    I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
    As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me--what might you,
    Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
    What might you think? No, I went round to work,
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
    This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
    And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Do you think 'tis this?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    It may be, very likely.

LORD POLONIUS

    Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
    That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
    When it proved otherwise?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Not that I know.

LORD POLONIUS

    [Pointing to his head and shoulder]
    Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How may we try it further?

LORD POLONIUS

    You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
    Here in the lobby.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    So he does indeed.

LORD POLONIUS

    At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
    Be you and I behind an arras then;
    Mark the encounter: if he love her not
    And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.

KING CLAUDIUS

    We will try it.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

LORD POLONIUS

    Away, I do beseech you, both away:
    I'll board him presently.

    Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants

    Enter HAMLET, reading
    O, give me leave:
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?

HAMLET

    Well, God-a-mercy.

LORD POLONIUS

    Do you know me, my lord?

HAMLET

    Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.

LORD POLONIUS

    Not I, my lord.

HAMLET

    Then I would you were so honest a man.

LORD POLONIUS

    Honest, my lord!

HAMLET

    Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
    one man picked out of ten thousand.

LORD POLONIUS

    That's very true, my lord.

HAMLET

    For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
    god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?

LORD POLONIUS

    I have, my lord.

HAMLET

    Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
    blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
    Friend, look to 't.

LORD POLONIUS

    [Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
    daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
    was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
    truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
    love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
    What do you read, my lord?

HAMLET

    Words, words, words.

LORD POLONIUS

    What is the matter, my lord?

HAMLET

    Between who?

LORD POLONIUS

    I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

HAMLET

    Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
    that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
    wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
    plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
    wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
    though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
    I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
    yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
    you could go backward.

LORD POLONIUS

    [Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
    in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?

HAMLET

    Into my grave.

LORD POLONIUS

    Indeed, that is out o' the air.

    Aside
    How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
    that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
    could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
    leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
    meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
    lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.

HAMLET

    You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
    more willingly part withal: except my life, except
    my life, except my life.

LORD POLONIUS

    Fare you well, my lord.

HAMLET

    These tedious old fools!

    Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

LORD POLONIUS

    You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.

ROSENCRANTZ

    [To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!

    Exit POLONIUS

GUILDENSTERN

    My honoured lord!

ROSENCRANTZ

    My most dear lord!

HAMLET

    My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
    Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

ROSENCRANTZ

    As the indifferent children of the earth.

GUILDENSTERN

    Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
    On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

HAMLET

    Nor the soles of her shoe?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Neither, my lord.

HAMLET

    Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
    her favours?

GUILDENSTERN

    'Faith, her privates we.

HAMLET

    In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
    is a strumpet. What's the news?

ROSENCRANTZ

    None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

HAMLET

    Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
    Let me question more in particular: what have you,
    my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
    that she sends you to prison hither?

GUILDENSTERN

    Prison, my lord!

HAMLET

    Denmark's a prison.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Then is the world one.

HAMLET

    A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
    wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.

ROSENCRANTZ

    We think not so, my lord.

HAMLET

    Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
    either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
    it is a prison.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
    narrow for your mind.

HAMLET

    O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
    myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
    have bad dreams.

GUILDENSTERN

    Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
    substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.

HAMLET

    A dream itself is but a shadow.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
    quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.

HAMLET

    Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
    outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
    to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.

ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN

    We'll wait upon you.

HAMLET

    No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
    of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
    man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
    beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?

ROSENCRANTZ

    To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

HAMLET

    Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
    thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
    too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
    your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
    deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.

GUILDENSTERN

    What should we say, my lord?

HAMLET

    Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
    for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
    which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
    I know the good king and queen have sent for you.

ROSENCRANTZ

    To what end, my lord?

HAMLET

    That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
    the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
    our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
    love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
    charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
    whether you were sent for, or no?

ROSENCRANTZ

    [Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?

HAMLET

    [Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
    love me, hold not off.

GUILDENSTERN

    My lord, we were sent for.

HAMLET

    I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
    prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
    and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
    wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
    custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
    with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
    earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
    excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
    o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
    with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
    me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
    What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
    how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
    express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
    in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
    world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
    what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
    me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
    you seem to say so.

ROSENCRANTZ

    My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

HAMLET

    Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?

ROSENCRANTZ

    To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
    lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
    you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
    coming, to offer you service.

HAMLET

    He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
    shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
    shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
    sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
    in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
    say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
    for't. What players are they?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.

HAMLET

    How chances it they travel? their residence, both
    in reputation and profit, was better both ways.

ROSENCRANTZ

    I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
    late innovation.

HAMLET

    Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
    in the city? are they so followed?

ROSENCRANTZ

    No, indeed, are they not.

HAMLET

    How comes it? do they grow rusty?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
    there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
    that cry out on the top of question, and are most
    tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
    fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
    call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
    goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.

HAMLET

    What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
    they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
    longer than they can sing? will they not say
    afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
    players--as it is most like, if their means are no
    better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
    exclaim against their own succession?

ROSENCRANTZ

    'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
    the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
    controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
    for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
    cuffs in the question.

HAMLET

    Is't possible?

GUILDENSTERN

    O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

HAMLET

    Do the boys carry it away?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.

HAMLET

    It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
    Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
    my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
    hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
    'Sblood, there is something in this more than
    natural, if philosophy could find it out.

    Flourish of trumpets within

GUILDENSTERN

    There are the players.

HAMLET

    Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
    come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
    and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
    lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
    must show fairly outward, should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
    uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.

GUILDENSTERN

    In what, my dear lord?

HAMLET

    I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
    southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.

    Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    Well be with you, gentlemen!

HAMLET

    Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
    hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
    out of his swaddling-clouts.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
    say an old man is twice a child.

HAMLET

    I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
    mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
    'twas so indeed.

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, I have news to tell you.

HAMLET

    My lord, I have news to tell you.
    When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--

LORD POLONIUS

    The actors are come hither, my lord.

HAMLET

    Buz, buz!

LORD POLONIUS

    Upon mine honour,--

HAMLET

    Then came each actor on his ass,--

LORD POLONIUS

    The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
    comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
    historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
    comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
    poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
    liberty, these are the only men.

HAMLET

    O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

LORD POLONIUS

    What a treasure had he, my lord?

HAMLET

    Why,
    'One fair daughter and no more,
    The which he loved passing well.'

LORD POLONIUS

    [Aside] Still on my daughter.

HAMLET

    Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

LORD POLONIUS

    If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
    that I love passing well.

HAMLET

    Nay, that follows not.

LORD POLONIUS

    What follows, then, my lord?

HAMLET

    Why,
    'As by lot, God wot,'
    and then, you know,
    'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
    the first row of the pious chanson will show you
    more; for look, where my abridgement comes.

    Enter four or five Players
    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
    to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
    friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
    comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
    lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
    nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
    apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
    ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
    to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
    we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
    of your quality; come, a passionate speech.

First Player

    What speech, my lord?

HAMLET

    I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
    never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
    play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
    caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
    it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
    cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
    digested in the scenes, set down with as much
    modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
    were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
    savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
    indict the author of affectation; but called it an
    honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
    much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
    chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
    thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
    Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
    at this line: let me see, let me see--
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
    it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
    Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
    With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
    Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
    Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
    That lend a tyrannous and damned light
    To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
    And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
    Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
    So, proceed you.

LORD POLONIUS

    'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
    good discretion.

First Player

    'Anon he finds him
    Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
    Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
    Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
    The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
    Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
    Which was declining on the milky head
    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
    And like a neutral to his will and matter,
    Did nothing.
    But, as we often see, against some storm,
    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
    The bold winds speechless and the orb below
    As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
    Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
    Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
    And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
    On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
    With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
    Now falls on Priam.
    Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
    In general synod 'take away her power;
    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
    As low as to the fiends!'

LORD POLONIUS

    This is too long.

HAMLET

    It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
    say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
    sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.

First Player

    'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'

HAMLET

    'The mobled queen?'

LORD POLONIUS

    That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.

First Player

    'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
    About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
    'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
    pronounced:
    But if the gods themselves did see her then
    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
    The instant burst of clamour that she made,
    Unless things mortal move them not at all,
    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
    And passion in the gods.'

LORD POLONIUS

    Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
    tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.

HAMLET

    'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
    Good my lord, will you see the players well
    bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
    they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
    time: after your death you were better have a bad
    epitaph than their ill report while you live.

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, I will use them according to their desert.

HAMLET

    God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
    after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
    Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
    they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
    Take them in.

LORD POLONIUS

    Come, sirs.

HAMLET

    Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.

    Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First
    Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
    Murder of Gonzago?

First Player

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
    study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
    I would set down and insert in't, could you not?

First Player

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
    not.

    Exit First Player
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
    welcome to Elsinore.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Good my lord!

HAMLET

    Ay, so, God be wi' ye;

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Now I am alone.
    O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That from her working all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
    As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
    Ha!
    'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
    And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
    That guilty creatures sitting at a play
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
    Play something like the murder of my father
    Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be the devil: and the devil hath power
    To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
    More relative than this: the play 's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 

KING CLAUDIUS

    And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

ROSENCRANTZ

    He does confess he feels himself distracted;
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.

GUILDENSTERN

    Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Did he receive you well?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Most like a gentleman.

GUILDENSTERN

    But with much forcing of his disposition.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
    Most free in his reply.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Did you assay him?
    To any pastime?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
    We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it: they are about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.

LORD POLONIUS

    'Tis most true:
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
    To hear and see the matter.

KING CLAUDIUS

    With all my heart; and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclined.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.

ROSENCRANTZ

    We shall, my lord.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS

    Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia:
    Her father and myself, lawful espials,
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge,
    And gather by him, as he is behaved,
    If 't be the affliction of his love or no
    That thus he suffers for.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I shall obey you.
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.

OPHELIA

    Madam, I wish it may.

    Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE

LORD POLONIUS

    Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.

    To OPHELIA
    Read on this book;
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
    'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The devil himself.

KING CLAUDIUS

    [Aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word:
    O heavy burthen!

LORD POLONIUS

    I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.

    Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

    Enter HAMLET

HAMLET

    To be, or not to be: that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause: there's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life;
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office and the spurns
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins remember'd.

OPHELIA

    Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?

HAMLET

    I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA

    My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
    That I have longed long to re-deliver;
    I pray you, now receive them.

HAMLET

    No, not I;
    I never gave you aught.

OPHELIA

    My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
    And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
    As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.

HAMLET

    Ha, ha! are you honest?

OPHELIA

    My lord?

HAMLET

    Are you fair?

OPHELIA

    What means your lordship?

HAMLET

    That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
    admit no discourse to your beauty.

OPHELIA

    Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
    with honesty?

HAMLET

    Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
    transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
    force of honesty can translate beauty into his
    likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
    time gives it proof. I did love you once.

OPHELIA

    Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

HAMLET

    You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
    so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
    it: I loved you not.

OPHELIA

    I was the more deceived.

HAMLET

    Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
    breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
    but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
    were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
    proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
    my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
    imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
    in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
    between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
    all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
    Where's your father?

OPHELIA

    At home, my lord.

HAMLET

    Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
    fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.

OPHELIA

    O, help him, you sweet heavens!

HAMLET

    If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
    thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
    snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
    nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
    marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
    what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
    and quickly too. Farewell.

OPHELIA

    O heavenly powers, restore him!

HAMLET

    I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
    has given you one face, and you make yourselves
    another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
    nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
    your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
    made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
    those that are married already, all but one, shall
    live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
    nunnery, go.

    Exit

OPHELIA

    O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
    The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
    To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

    Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

KING CLAUDIUS

    Love! his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
    For the demand of our neglected tribute
    Haply the seas and countries different
    With variable objects shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

LORD POLONIUS

    It shall do well: but yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
    We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
    But, if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief: let her be round with him;
    And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him, or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.

KING CLAUDIUS

    It shall be so:
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

    Enter HAMLET and Players 

HAMLET

    Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
    you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
    as many of your players do, I had as lief the
    town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
    too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
    for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
    the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
    a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
    offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
    periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
    very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
    for the most part are capable of nothing but
    inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
    a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
    out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

First Player

    I warrant your honour.

HAMLET

    Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
    be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
    word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
    the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
    from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
    first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
    mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
    the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
    or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
    laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
    censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
    players that I have seen play, and heard others
    praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
    that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
    the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
    nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
    well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

First Player

    I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
    sir.

HAMLET

    O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
    your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
    for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
    set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
    too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered:
    that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
    in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

    Exeunt Players

    Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
    How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?

LORD POLONIUS

    And the queen too, and that presently.

HAMLET

    Bid the players make haste.

    Exit POLONIUS
    Will you two help to hasten them?

ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN

    We will, my lord.

    What ho! Horatio!

    Enter HORATIO

HORATIO

    Here, sweet lord, at your service.

HAMLET

    Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation coped withal.

HORATIO

    O, my dear lord,--

HAMLET

    Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
    As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
    A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
    That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
    There is a play to-night before the king;
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance
    Which I have told thee of my father's death:
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.

HORATIO

    Well, my lord:
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

HAMLET

    They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
    Get you a place.

    Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

KING CLAUDIUS

    How fares our cousin Hamlet?

HAMLET

    Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
    the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
    are not mine.

HAMLET

    No, nor mine now.

    To POLONIUS
    My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

LORD POLONIUS

    That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

HAMLET

    What did you enact?

LORD POLONIUS

    I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
    Capitol; Brutus killed me.

HAMLET

    It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
    there. Be the players ready?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

HAMLET

    No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

LORD POLONIUS

    [To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?

HAMLET

    Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

    Lying down at OPHELIA's feet

OPHELIA

    No, my lord.

HAMLET

    I mean, my head upon your lap?

OPHELIA

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    Do you think I meant country matters?

OPHELIA

    I think nothing, my lord.

HAMLET

    That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

OPHELIA

    What is, my lord?

HAMLET

    Nothing.

OPHELIA

    You are merry, my lord.

HAMLET

    Who, I?

OPHELIA

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
    but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
    mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.

OPHELIA

    Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

HAMLET

    So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
    I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
    months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
    hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
    a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
    then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
    the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
    the hobby-horse is forgot.'

    Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

    Exeunt

OPHELIA

    What means this, my lord?

HAMLET

    Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

OPHELIA

    Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

    Enter Prologue

HAMLET

    We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
    keep counsel; they'll tell all.

OPHELIA

    Will he tell us what this show meant?

HAMLET

    Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
    ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.

OPHELIA

    You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.

Prologue

    For us, and for our tragedy,
    Here stooping to your clemency,
    We beg your hearing patiently.

    Exit

HAMLET

    Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

OPHELIA

    'Tis brief, my lord.

HAMLET

    As woman's love.

    Enter two Players, King and Queen

Player King

    Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
    Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
    And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
    About the world have times twelve thirties been,
    Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
    Unite commutual in most sacred bands.

Player Queen

    So many journeys may the sun and moon
    Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
    But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
    So far from cheer and from your former state,
    That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
    Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
    For women's fear and love holds quantity;
    In neither aught, or in extremity.
    Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
    And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
    Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

Player King

    'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
    My operant powers their functions leave to do:
    And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
    Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
    For husband shalt thou--

Player Queen

    O, confound the rest!
    Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
    In second husband let me be accurst!
    None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

HAMLET

    [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.

Player Queen

    The instances that second marriage move
    Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
    A second time I kill my husband dead,
    When second husband kisses me in bed.

Player King

    I do believe you think what now you speak;
    But what we do determine oft we break.
    Purpose is but the slave to memory,
    Of violent birth, but poor validity;
    Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
    But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
    Most necessary 'tis that we forget
    To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
    What to ourselves in passion we propose,
    The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
    The violence of either grief or joy
    Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
    Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
    This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
    That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
    For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
    Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
    The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
    The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
    And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
    And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
    Directly seasons him his enemy.
    But, orderly to end where I begun,
    Our wills and fates do so contrary run
    That our devices still are overthrown;
    Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
    So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
    But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

Player Queen

    Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
    Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
    To desperation turn my trust and hope!
    An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
    Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
    Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
    Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
    If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

HAMLET

    If she should break it now!

Player King

    'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
    My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
    The tedious day with sleep.

    Sleeps

Player Queen

    Sleep rock thy brain,
    And never come mischance between us twain!

    Exit

HAMLET

    Madam, how like you this play?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    The lady protests too much, methinks.

HAMLET

    O, but she'll keep her word.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?

HAMLET

    No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
    i' the world.

KING CLAUDIUS

    What do you call the play?

HAMLET

    The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
    is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
    the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
    anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
    that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
    touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
    withers are unwrung.

    Enter LUCIANUS
    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

OPHELIA

    You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

HAMLET

    I could interpret between you and your love, if I
    could see the puppets dallying.

OPHELIA

    You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

HAMLET

    It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

OPHELIA

    Still better, and worse.

HAMLET

    So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
    pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
    'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'

LUCIANUS

    Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
    Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
    Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
    With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
    Thy natural magic and dire property,
    On wholesome life usurp immediately.

    Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears

HAMLET

    He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
    name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
    choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
    gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

OPHELIA

    The king rises.

HAMLET

    What, frighted with false fire!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    How fares my lord?

LORD POLONIUS

    Give o'er the play.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Give me some light: away!

All

    Lights, lights, lights!

    Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO

HAMLET

    Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
    The hart ungalled play;
    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
    So runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
    the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
    Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
    fellowship in a cry of players, sir?

HORATIO

    Half a share.

HAMLET

    A whole one, I.
    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
    This realm dismantled was
    Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
    A very, very--pajock.

HORATIO

    You might have rhymed.

HAMLET

    O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
    thousand pound. Didst perceive?

HORATIO

    Very well, my lord.

HAMLET

    Upon the talk of the poisoning?

HORATIO

    I did very well note him.

HAMLET

    Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
    For if the king like not the comedy,
    Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

    Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

GUILDENSTERN

    Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

HAMLET

    Sir, a whole history.

GUILDENSTERN

    The king, sir,--

HAMLET

    Ay, sir, what of him?

GUILDENSTERN

    Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.

HAMLET

    With drink, sir?

GUILDENSTERN

    No, my lord, rather with choler.

HAMLET

    Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
    signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
    to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
    more choler.

GUILDENSTERN

    Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
    start not so wildly from my affair.

HAMLET

    I am tame, sir: pronounce.

GUILDENSTERN

    The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
    spirit, hath sent me to you.

HAMLET

    You are welcome.

GUILDENSTERN

    Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
    breed. If it shall please you to make me a
    wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
    commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.

HAMLET

    Sir, I cannot.

GUILDENSTERN

    What, my lord?

HAMLET

    Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
    sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
    or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
    more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--

ROSENCRANTZ

    Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
    into amazement and admiration.

HAMLET

    O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
    is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
    admiration? Impart.

ROSENCRANTZ

    She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
    go to bed.

HAMLET

    We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
    you any further trade with us?

ROSENCRANTZ

    My lord, you once did love me.

HAMLET

    So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
    do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
    you deny your griefs to your friend.

HAMLET

    Sir, I lack advancement.

ROSENCRANTZ

    How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
    himself for your succession in Denmark?

HAMLET

    Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
    is something musty.

    Re-enter Players with recorders
    O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
    you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
    as if you would drive me into a toil?

GUILDENSTERN

    O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
    unmannerly.

HAMLET

    I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
    this pipe?

GUILDENSTERN

    My lord, I cannot.

HAMLET

    I pray you.

GUILDENSTERN

    Believe me, I cannot.

HAMLET

    I do beseech you.

GUILDENSTERN

    I know no touch of it, my lord.

HAMLET

    'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
    your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
    mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
    Look you, these are the stops.

GUILDENSTERN

    But these cannot I command to any utterance of
    harmony; I have not the skill.

HAMLET

    Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
    me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
    my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
    mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
    the top of my compass: and there is much music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
    you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
    easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
    instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
    cannot play upon me.

    Enter POLONIUS
    God bless you, sir!

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
    presently.

HAMLET

    Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

LORD POLONIUS

    By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

HAMLET

    Methinks it is like a weasel.

LORD POLONIUS

    It is backed like a weasel.

HAMLET

    Or like a whale?

LORD POLONIUS

    Very like a whale.

HAMLET

    Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
    me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.

LORD POLONIUS

    I will say so.

HAMLET

    By and by is easily said.

    Exit POLONIUS
    Leave me, friends.

    Exeunt all but HAMLET
    Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
    How in my words soever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

    Exit

SCENE III. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 

KING CLAUDIUS

    I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you:
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.

GUILDENSTERN

    We will ourselves provide:
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your majesty.

ROSENCRANTZ

    The single and peculiar life is bound,
    With all the strength and armour of the mind,
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
    The lives of many. The cease of majesty
    Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
    What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.

ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN

    We will haste us.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

    Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
    To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
    And tell you what I know.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thanks, dear my lord.

    Exit POLONIUS
    O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will:
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murder,
    My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
    There is no shuffling, there the action lies
    In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
    Try what repentance can: what can it not?
    Yet what can it when one can not repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
    Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
    All may be well.

    Retires and kneels

    Enter HAMLET

HAMLET

    Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
    And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
    He took my father grossly, full of bread;
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
    No!
    Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
    When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
    Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't;
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    [Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.

    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS 

LORD POLONIUS

    He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
    Pray you, be round with him.

HAMLET

    [Within] Mother, mother, mother!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I'll warrant you,
    Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

    POLONIUS hides behind the arras

    Enter HAMLET

HAMLET

    Now, mother, what's the matter?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

HAMLET

    Mother, you have my father much offended.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

HAMLET

    Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Why, how now, Hamlet!

HAMLET

    What's the matter now?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Have you forgot me?

HAMLET

    No, by the rood, not so:
    You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
    And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

HAMLET

    Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
    Help, help, ho!

LORD POLONIUS

    [Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!

HAMLET

    [Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

    Makes a pass through the arras

LORD POLONIUS

    [Behind] O, I am slain!

    Falls and dies

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O me, what hast thou done?

HAMLET

    Nay, I know not:
    Is it the king?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

HAMLET

    A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    As kill a king!

HAMLET

    Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

    Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
    If it be made of penetrable stuff,
    If damned custom have not brass'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?

HAMLET

    Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
    Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love
    And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
    As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Ay me, what act,
    That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

HAMLET

    Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
    A combination and a form indeed,
    Where every god did seem to set his seal,
    To give the world assurance of a man:
    This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
    Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserved some quantity of choice,
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
    And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn
    And reason panders will.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O Hamlet, speak no more:
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.

HAMLET

    Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty,--

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O, speak to me no more;
    These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
    No more, sweet Hamlet!

HAMLET

    A murderer and a villain;
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
    And put it in his pocket!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    No more!

HAMLET

    A king of shreds and patches,--

    Enter Ghost
    Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, he's mad!

HAMLET

    Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
    The important acting of your dread command? O, say!

Ghost

    Do not forget: this visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
    O, step between her and her fighting soul:
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
    Speak to her, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    How is it with you, lady?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy
    And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
    Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
    Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

HAMLET

    On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects: then what I have to do
    Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    To whom do you speak this?

HAMLET

    Do you see nothing there?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

HAMLET

    Nor did you nothing hear?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    No, nothing but ourselves.

HAMLET

    Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he lived!
    Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

    Exit Ghost

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    This the very coinage of your brain:
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.

HAMLET

    Ecstasy!
    My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
    And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
    That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will re-word; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
    That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

HAMLET

    O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half.
    Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
    Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
    And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
    I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,

    Pointing to POLONIUS
    I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
    To punish me with this and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind:
    Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What shall I do?

HAMLET

    Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
    Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
    Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
    And break your own neck down.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.

HAMLET

    I must to England; you know that?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alack,
    I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

HAMLET

    There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
    Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines,
    And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing:
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
    Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.

    Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS

ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 

KING CLAUDIUS

    There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
    You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Bestow this place on us a little while.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!

KING CLAUDIUS

    What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
    Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
    And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
    The unseen good old man.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there:
    His liberty is full of threats to all;
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
    This mad young man: but so much was our love,
    We would not understand what was most fit;
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
    But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
    We must, with all our majesty and skill,
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

    Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
    And let them know, both what we mean to do,
    And what's untimely done. O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the castle.

    Enter HAMLET 

HAMLET

    Safely stowed.

ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:

    [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

HAMLET

    What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
    O, here they come.

    Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

ROSENCRANTZ

    What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

HAMLET

    Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.

HAMLET

    Do not believe it.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Believe what?

HAMLET

    That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
    Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
    replication should be made by the son of a king?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

HAMLET

    Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
    rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
    king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
    an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
    be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
    gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
    shall be dry again.

ROSENCRANTZ

    I understand you not, my lord.

HAMLET

    I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
    foolish ear.

ROSENCRANTZ

    My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
    with us to the king.

HAMLET

    The body is with the king, but the king is not with
    the body. The king is a thing--

GUILDENSTERN

    A thing, my lord!

HAMLET

    Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended 

KING CLAUDIUS

    I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
    He's loved of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are relieved,
    Or not at all.

    Enter ROSENCRANTZ
    How now! what hath befall'n?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.

KING CLAUDIUS

    But where is he?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Bring him before us.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.

    Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS

    Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

HAMLET

    At supper.

KING CLAUDIUS

    At supper! where?

HAMLET

    Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
    worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
    creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
    maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
    variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
    that's the end.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Alas, alas!

HAMLET

    A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
    king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

KING CLAUDIUS

    What dost you mean by this?

HAMLET

    Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
    progress through the guts of a beggar.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Where is Polonius?

HAMLET

    In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
    find him not there, seek him i' the other place
    yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
    this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
    stairs into the lobby.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Go seek him there.

    To some Attendants

HAMLET

    He will stay till ye come.

    Exeunt Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS

    Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
    Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
    The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
    The associates tend, and every thing is bent
    For England.

HAMLET

    For England!

KING CLAUDIUS

    Ay, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    Good.

KING CLAUDIUS

    So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

HAMLET

    I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
    England! Farewell, dear mother.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thy loving father, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
    and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
    Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
    That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

    Exit

SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.

    Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching 

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
    Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promised march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.

Captain

    I will do't, my lord.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Go softly on.

    Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers

    Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

HAMLET

    Good sir, whose powers are these?

Captain

    They are of Norway, sir.

HAMLET

    How purposed, sir, I pray you?

Captain

    Against some part of Poland.

HAMLET

    Who commands them, sir?

Captain

    The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.

HAMLET

    Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?

Captain

    Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

HAMLET

    Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

Captain

    Yes, it is already garrison'd.

HAMLET

    Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw:
    This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

Captain

    God be wi' you, sir.

    Exit

ROSENCRANTZ

    Wilt please you go, my lord?

HAMLET

    I'll be with you straight go a little before.

    Exeunt all except HAMLET
    How all occasions do inform against me,
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
    Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and god-like reason
    To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on the event,
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward, I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
    Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
    Witness this army of such mass and charge
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
    Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
    That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

    Exit

SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.

    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman 

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I will not speak with her.

Gentleman

    She is importunate, indeed distract:
    Her mood will needs be pitied.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What would she have?

Gentleman

    She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
    yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

HORATIO

    'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Let her come in.

    Exit HORATIO
    To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
    Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

    Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA

OPHELIA

    Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    How now, Ophelia!

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    How should I your true love know
    From another one?
    By his cockle hat and staff,
    And his sandal shoon.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

OPHELIA

    Say you? nay, pray you, mark.

    Sings
    He is dead and gone, lady,
    He is dead and gone;
    At his head a grass-green turf,
    At his heels a stone.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Nay, but, Ophelia,--

OPHELIA

    Pray you, mark.

    Sings
    White his shroud as the mountain snow,--

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, look here, my lord.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    Larded with sweet flowers
    Which bewept to the grave did go
    With true-love showers.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How do you, pretty lady?

OPHELIA

    Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
    daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
    what we may be. God be at your table!

KING CLAUDIUS

    Conceit upon her father.

OPHELIA

    Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
    ask you what it means, say you this:

    Sings
    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
    All in the morning betime,
    And I a maid at your window,
    To be your Valentine.
    Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
    And dupp'd the chamber-door;
    Let in the maid, that out a maid
    Never departed more.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Pretty Ophelia!

OPHELIA

    Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:

    Sings
    By Gis and by Saint Charity,
    Alack, and fie for shame!
    Young men will do't, if they come to't;
    By cock, they are to blame.
    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
    You promised me to wed.
    So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
    An thou hadst not come to my bed.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How long hath she been thus?

OPHELIA

    I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
    cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
    i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
    and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
    coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
    good night, good night.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    Follow her close; give her good watch,
    I pray you.

    Exit HORATIO
    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies
    But in battalions. First, her father slain:
    Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
    Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
    For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
    In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
    Gives me superfluous death.

    A noise within

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alack, what noise is this?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

    Enter another Gentleman
    What is the matter?

Gentleman

    Save yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
    Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
    'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!

KING CLAUDIUS

    The doors are broke.

    Noise within

    Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following

LAERTES

    Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.

Danes

    No, let's come in.

LAERTES

    I pray you, give me leave.

Danes

    We will, we will.

    They retire without the door

LAERTES

    I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Calmly, good Laertes.

LAERTES

    That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
    Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
    Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
    Of my true mother.

KING CLAUDIUS

    What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
    Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.

LAERTES

    Where is my father?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Dead.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    But not by him.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Let him demand his fill.

LAERTES

    How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the worlds I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
    Most thoroughly for my father.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Who shall stay you?

LAERTES

    My will, not all the world:
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
    They shall go far with little.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
    That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?

LAERTES

    None but his enemies.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Will you know them then?

LAERTES

    To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
    And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Why, now you speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensible in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.

Danes

    [Within] Let her come in.

LAERTES

    How now! what noise is that?

    Re-enter OPHELIA
    O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
    Should be as moral as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    They bore him barefaced on the bier;
    Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
    And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
    Fare you well, my dove!

LAERTES

    Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    You must sing a-down a-down,
    An you call him a-down-a.
    O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
    steward, that stole his master's daughter.

LAERTES

    This nothing's more than matter.

OPHELIA

    There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
    love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.

LAERTES

    A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.

OPHELIA

    There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
    for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
    herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
    a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
    some violets, but they withered all when my father
    died: they say he made a good end,--

    Sings
    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

LAERTES

    Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    And will he not come again?
    And will he not come again?
    No, no, he is dead:
    Go to thy death-bed:
    He never will come again.
    His beard was as white as snow,
    All flaxen was his poll:
    He is gone, he is gone,
    And we cast away moan:
    God ha' mercy on his soul!
    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.

    Exit

LAERTES

    Do you see this, O God?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.

LAERTES

    Let this be so;
    His means of death, his obscure funeral--
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.

KING CLAUDIUS

    So you shall;
    And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you, go with me.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.

    Enter HORATIO and a Servant 

HORATIO

    What are they that would speak with me?

Servant

    Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.

HORATIO

    Let them come in.

    Exit Servant
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

    Enter Sailors

First Sailor

    God bless you, sir.

HORATIO

    Let him bless thee too.

First Sailor

    He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
    you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
    bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
    let to know it is.

HORATIO

    [Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
    this, give these fellows some means to the king:
    they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
    at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
    chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
    a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
    them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
    I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
    me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
    did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
    have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
    with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
    have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
    dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
    the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
    where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
    course for England: of them I have much to tell
    thee. Farewell.
    'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
    Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
    And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES 

KING CLAUDIUS

    Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
    And you must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.

LAERTES

    It well appears: but tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats,
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, for two special reasons;
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive,
    Why to a public count I might not go,
    Is the great love the general gender bear him;
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.

LAERTES

    And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desperate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
    I loved your father, and we love ourself;
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--

    Enter a Messenger
    How now! what news?

Messenger

    Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your majesty; this to the queen.

KING CLAUDIUS

    From Hamlet! who brought them?

Messenger

    Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
    They were given me by Claudio; he received them
    Of him that brought them.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.

    Exit Messenger

    Reads
    'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
    your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
    your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
    pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
    and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

LAERTES

    Know you the hand?

KING CLAUDIUS

    'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?

LAERTES

    I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
    It warms the very sickness in my heart,
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'

KING CLAUDIUS

    If it be so, Laertes--
    As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
    Will you be ruled by me?

LAERTES

    Ay, my lord;
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

KING CLAUDIUS

    To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
    And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
    And call it accident.

LAERTES

    My lord, I will be ruled;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.

KING CLAUDIUS

    It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one, and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.

LAERTES

    What part is that, my lord?

KING CLAUDIUS

    A very riband in the cap of youth,
    Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
    I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
    As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
    With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.

LAERTES

    A Norman was't?

KING CLAUDIUS

    A Norman.

LAERTES

    Upon my life, Lamond.

KING CLAUDIUS

    The very same.

LAERTES

    I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
    And gem of all the nation.

KING CLAUDIUS

    He made confession of you,
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
    If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
    He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
    Now, out of this,--

LAERTES

    What out of this, my lord?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart?

LAERTES

    Why ask you this?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time;
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too much: that we would do
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
    Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?

LAERTES

    To cut his throat i' the church.

KING CLAUDIUS

    No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
    Most generous and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
    Requite him for your father.

LAERTES

    I will do't:
    And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Let's further think of this;
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance,
    'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold,
    If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
    When in your motion you are hot and dry--
    As make your bouts more violent to that end--
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
    A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.

    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE
    How now, sweet queen!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

LAERTES

    Drown'd! O, where?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
    There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
    Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
    Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element: but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.

LAERTES

    Alas, then, she is drown'd?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Drown'd, drown'd.

LAERTES

    Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
    But that this folly douts it.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    Let's follow, Gertrude:
    How much I had to do to calm his rage!
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.

    Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c 

First Clown

    Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
    wilfully seeks her own salvation?

Second Clown

    I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
    straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
    Christian burial.

First Clown

    How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
    own defence?

Second Clown

    Why, 'tis found so.

First Clown

    It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
    here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
    it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
    is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
    herself wittingly.

Second Clown

    Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--

First Clown

    Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
    stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
    and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
    goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
    and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
    that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.

Second Clown

    But is this law?

First Clown

    Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.

Second Clown

    Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
    a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
    Christian burial.

First Clown

    Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
    great folk should have countenance in this world to
    drown or hang themselves, more than their even
    Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
    gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
    they hold up Adam's profession.

Second Clown

    Was he a gentleman?

First Clown

    He was the first that ever bore arms.

Second Clown

    Why, he had none.

First Clown

    What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
    Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
    could he dig without arms? I'll put another
    question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself--

Second Clown

    Go to.

First Clown

    What is he that builds stronger than either the
    mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

Second Clown

    The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
    thousand tenants.

First Clown

    I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
    does well; but how does it well? it does well to
    those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
    gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
    the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.

Second Clown

    'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
    a carpenter?'

First Clown

    Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

Second Clown

    Marry, now I can tell.

First Clown

    To't.

Second Clown

    Mass, I cannot tell.

    Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance

First Clown

    Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
    ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
    you are asked this question next, say 'a
    grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
    doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
    stoup of liquor.

    Exit Second Clown

    He digs and sings
    In youth, when I did love, did love,
    Methought it was very sweet,
    To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
    O, methought, there was nothing meet.

HAMLET

    Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
    sings at grave-making?

HORATIO

    Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

HAMLET

    'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
    the daintier sense.

First Clown

    [Sings]
    But age, with his stealing steps,
    Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
    And hath shipped me intil the land,
    As if I had never been such.

    Throws up a skull

HAMLET

    That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
    how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
    Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
    might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
    now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
    might it not?

HORATIO

    It might, my lord.

HAMLET

    Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
    sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
    be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
    such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?

HORATIO

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
    knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
    here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
    see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
    but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.

First Clown

    [Sings]
    A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
    For and a shrouding sheet:
    O, a pit of clay for to be made
    For such a guest is meet.

    Throws up another skull

HAMLET

    There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
    lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
    his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
    suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
    sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
    his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
    in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
    his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
    his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
    the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
    pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
    no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
    the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
    very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
    this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?

HORATIO

    Not a jot more, my lord.

HAMLET

    Is not parchment made of sheepskins?

HORATIO

    Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.

HAMLET

    They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
    in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
    grave's this, sirrah?

First Clown

    Mine, sir.

    Sings
    O, a pit of clay for to be made
    For such a guest is meet.

HAMLET

    I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.

First Clown

    You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
    yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.

HAMLET

    'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
    'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

First Clown

    'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
    you.

HAMLET

    What man dost thou dig it for?

First Clown

    For no man, sir.

HAMLET

    What woman, then?

First Clown

    For none, neither.

HAMLET

    Who is to be buried in't?

First Clown

    One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.

HAMLET

    How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
    card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
    Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
    it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
    peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
    gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
    grave-maker?

First Clown

    Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
    that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.

HAMLET

    How long is that since?

First Clown

    Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
    was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
    is mad, and sent into England.

HAMLET

    Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

First Clown

    Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
    there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.

HAMLET

    Why?

First Clown

    'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
    are as mad as he.

HAMLET

    How came he mad?

First Clown

    Very strangely, they say.

HAMLET

    How strangely?

First Clown

    Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

HAMLET

    Upon what ground?

First Clown

    Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
    and boy, thirty years.

HAMLET

    How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?

First Clown

    I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
    have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
    hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
    or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.

HAMLET

    Why he more than another?

First Clown

    Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
    he will keep out water a great while; and your water
    is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
    Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
    three and twenty years.

HAMLET

    Whose was it?

First Clown

    A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?

HAMLET

    Nay, I know not.

First Clown

    A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
    flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
    sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.

HAMLET

    This?

First Clown

    E'en that.

HAMLET

    Let me see.

    Takes the skull
    Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
    of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
    borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
    abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
    it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
    not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
    gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
    that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
    now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
    Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
    her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
    come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
    me one thing.

HORATIO

    What's that, my lord?

HAMLET

    Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
    the earth?

HORATIO

    E'en so.

HAMLET

    And smelt so? pah!

    Puts down the skull

HORATIO

    E'en so, my lord.

HAMLET

    To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
    not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
    till he find it stopping a bung-hole?

HORATIO

    'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

HAMLET

    No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
    modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
    thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
    Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
    earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
    was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
    O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
    Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.

    Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c
    The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desperate hand
    Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.

    Retiring with HORATIO

LAERTES

    What ceremony else?

HAMLET

    That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth: mark.

LAERTES

    What ceremony else?

First Priest

    Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
    As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
    Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
    Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.

LAERTES

    Must there no more be done?

First Priest

    No more be done:
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.

LAERTES

    Lay her i' the earth:
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A ministering angel shall my sister be,
    When thou liest howling.

HAMLET

    What, the fair Ophelia!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Sweets to the sweet: farewell!

    Scattering flowers
    I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.

LAERTES

    O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:

    Leaps into the grave
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
    To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.

HAMLET

    [Advancing] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.

    Leaps into the grave

LAERTES

    The devil take thy soul!

    Grappling with him

HAMLET

    Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I something in me dangerous,
    Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Pluck them asunder.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Hamlet, Hamlet!

All

    Gentlemen,--

HORATIO

    Good my lord, be quiet.

    The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave

HAMLET

    Why I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O my son, what theme?

HAMLET

    I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
    Could not, with all their quantity of love,
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, he is mad, Laertes.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    For love of God, forbear him.

HAMLET

    'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
    And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    This is mere madness:
    And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
    Anon, as patient as the female dove,
    When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
    His silence will sit drooping.

HAMLET

    Hear you, sir;
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew and dog will have his day.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.

    Exit HORATIO

    To LAERTES
    Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
    We'll put the matter to the present push.
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
    This grave shall have a living monument:
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

    Enter HAMLET and HORATIO 

HAMLET

    So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
    You do remember all the circumstance?

HORATIO

    Remember it, my lord?

HAMLET

    Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
    That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
    Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
    And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
    When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will,--

HORATIO

    That is most certain.

HAMLET

    Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold,
    My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
    O royal knavery!--an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons
    Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
    With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.

HORATIO

    Is't possible?

HAMLET

    Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?

HORATIO

    I beseech you.

HAMLET

    Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
    Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play--I sat me down,
    Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
    The effect of what I wrote?

HORATIO

    Ay, good my lord.

HAMLET

    An earnest conjuration from the king,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving-time allow'd.

HORATIO

    How was this seal'd?

HAMLET

    Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in form of the other,
    Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.

HORATIO

    So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

HAMLET

    Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow:
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.

HORATIO

    Why, what a king is this!

HAMLET

    Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
    He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
    Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
    To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?

HORATIO

    It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.

HAMLET

    It will be short: the interim is mine;
    And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself;
    For, by the image of my cause, I see
    The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
    But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a towering passion.

HORATIO

    Peace! who comes here?

    Enter OSRIC

OSRIC

    Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

HAMLET

    I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?

HORATIO

    No, my good lord.

HAMLET

    Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
    know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
    beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
    the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
    spacious in the possession of dirt.

OSRIC

    Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
    should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

HAMLET

    I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
    spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.

OSRIC

    I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

HAMLET

    No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
    northerly.

OSRIC

    It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

HAMLET

    But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
    complexion.

OSRIC

    Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
    'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
    majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
    great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--

HAMLET

    I beseech you, remember--

    HAMLET moves him to put on his hat

OSRIC

    Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
    Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
    me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
    differences, of very soft society and great showing:
    indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
    calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
    continent of what part a gentleman would see.

HAMLET

    Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
    though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
    dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
    neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
    verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
    great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
    rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
    semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
    him, his umbrage, nothing more.

OSRIC

    Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

HAMLET

    The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
    in our more rawer breath?

OSRIC

    Sir?

HORATIO

    Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
    You will do't, sir, really.

HAMLET

    What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

OSRIC

    Of Laertes?

HORATIO

    His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.

HAMLET

    Of him, sir.

OSRIC

    I know you are not ignorant--

HAMLET

    I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
    it would not much approve me. Well, sir?

OSRIC

    You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--

HAMLET

    I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
    him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
    know himself.

OSRIC

    I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
    laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

HAMLET

    What's his weapon?

OSRIC

    Rapier and dagger.

HAMLET

    That's two of his weapons: but, well.

OSRIC

    The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
    horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
    it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
    assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
    carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
    responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
    and of very liberal conceit.

HAMLET

    What call you the carriages?

HORATIO

    I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.

OSRIC

    The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

HAMLET

    The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
    could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
    be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
    against six French swords, their assigns, and three
    liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
    against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?

OSRIC

    The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
    between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
    three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
    would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
    would vouchsafe the answer.

HAMLET

    How if I answer 'no'?

OSRIC

    I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

HAMLET

    Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
    majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
    the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
    king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
    if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

OSRIC

    Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

HAMLET

    To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.

OSRIC

    I commend my duty to your lordship.

HAMLET

    Yours, yours.

    Exit OSRIC
    He does well to commend it himself; there are no
    tongues else for's turn.

HORATIO

    This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

HAMLET

    He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
    Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
    know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
    the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
    yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
    but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

    Enter a Lord

Lord

    My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
    Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
    the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
    play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.

HAMLET

    I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
    pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
    or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.

Lord

    The king and queen and all are coming down.

HAMLET

    In happy time.

Lord

    The queen desires you to use some gentle
    entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

HAMLET

    She well instructs me.

    Exit Lord

HORATIO

    You will lose this wager, my lord.

HAMLET

    I do not think so: since he went into France, I
    have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
    odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
    about my heart: but it is no matter.

HORATIO

    Nay, good my lord,--

HAMLET

    It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
    gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.

HORATIO

    If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
    forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
    fit.

HAMLET

    Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
    providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
    'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
    now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
    readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
    leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c

KING CLAUDIUS

    Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

    KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's

HAMLET

    Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done,
    That might your nature, honour and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
    If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
    That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
    And hurt my brother.

LAERTES

    I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
    To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
    Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
    I have a voice and precedent of peace,
    To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.

HAMLET

    I embrace it freely;
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.

LAERTES

    Come, one for me.

HAMLET

    I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.

LAERTES

    You mock me, sir.

HAMLET

    No, by this hand.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?

HAMLET

    Very well, my lord
    Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

LAERTES

    This is too heavy, let me see another.

HAMLET

    This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

    They prepare to play

OSRIC

    Ay, my good lord.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
    The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
    And in the cup an union shall he throw,
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
    'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
    And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

HAMLET

    Come on, sir.

LAERTES

    Come, my lord.

    They play

HAMLET

    One.

LAERTES

    No.

HAMLET

    Judgment.

OSRIC

    A hit, a very palpable hit.

LAERTES

    Well; again.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.

    Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within
    Give him the cup.

HAMLET

    I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.

    They play
    Another hit; what say you?

LAERTES

    A touch, a touch, I do confess.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Our son shall win.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
    The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    Good madam!

KING CLAUDIUS

    Gertrude, do not drink.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

KING CLAUDIUS

    [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.

HAMLET

    I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Come, let me wipe thy face.

LAERTES

    My lord, I'll hit him now.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I do not think't.

LAERTES

    [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

HAMLET

    Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
    I pray you, pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

LAERTES

    Say you so? come on.

    They play

OSRIC

    Nothing, neither way.

LAERTES

    Have at you now!

    LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES

KING CLAUDIUS

    Part them; they are incensed.

HAMLET

    Nay, come, again.

    QUEEN GERTRUDE falls

OSRIC

    Look to the queen there, ho!

HORATIO

    They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

OSRIC

    How is't, Laertes?

LAERTES

    Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

HAMLET

    How does the queen?

KING CLAUDIUS

    She swounds to see them bleed.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.

    Dies

HAMLET

    O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
    Treachery! Seek it out.

LAERTES

    It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good;
    In thee there is not half an hour of life;
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
    Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
    I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

HAMLET

    The point!--envenom'd too!
    Then, venom, to thy work.

    Stabs KING CLAUDIUS

All

    Treason! treason!

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

HAMLET

    Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.

    KING CLAUDIUS dies

LAERTES

    He is justly served;
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me.

    Dies

HAMLET

    Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
    Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.

HORATIO

    Never believe it:
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
    Here's yet some liquor left.

HAMLET

    As thou'rt a man,
    Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
    Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.

    March afar off, and shot within
    What warlike noise is this?

OSRIC

    Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.

HAMLET

    O, I die, Horatio;
    The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
    I cannot live to hear the news from England;
    But I do prophesy the election lights
    On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
    So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited. The rest is silence.

    Dies

HORATIO

    Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
    Why does the drum come hither?

    March within

    Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Where is this sight?

HORATIO

    What is it ye would see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck?

First Ambassador

    The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late:
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
    Where should we have our thanks?

HORATIO

    Not from his mouth,
    Had it the ability of life to thank you:
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arrived give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about: so shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
    Truly deliver.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
    Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

HORATIO

    Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
    On plots and errors, happen.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
    Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

    A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off

GEWIDMET 



Vorwort zur ersten Auflage. 

Dieses Buch ist eine Bearbeitung einiger Vorträge, die ich im letzten 
Winter vor einem größeren Publikum gehalten habe. Die Schwierigkeiten, 
die das Verständnis der Relativitätstheorie dem mathematisch und physi- 
kalisch nicht geschulten Hörer oder Leser bereitet, scheinen mir haupt- 
sächlich dadurch zu entstehen, daß ihm die Grundbegriffe und Tatsachen 
der Physik, besonders der Mechanik, nicht geläufig sind. Daher habe 
ich bei den Vorträgen ganz einfache, qualitative Experimente gezeigt, 
die zur Einführung der Begriffe wie Geschwindigkeit, Beschleunigung, 
Masse, Kraft, Feldstärke usw. dienten. Bei dem Versuche, ein ähnliches 
Mittel für das gedruckte Buch ausfindig zu machen, kam ich auf die hier 
gewählte, halb historische Darstellung, die, wie ich hoffe, den trockenen 
Stil der elementaren Lehrbücher der Physik vermeidet. Aber ich muß 
betonen, daß die historische Anordnung nur das Gewand ist, das die 
Hauptsache, den logischen Zusammenhang, um so klarer hervorheben soll. 
Das einmal angefangene Verfahren zwang zur Vollständigkeit, und dadurch 
schwoll mir das Unternehmen unter den Händen zu dem Umfange an, 
in dem es jetzt vorliegt. 

An mathematischen Kenntnissen setze ich möglichst wenig voraus. 
Ich habe nicht nur die höhere Mathematik zu vermeiden gesucht, son- 
dern auch von dem Gebrauche elementarer Funktionen, wie des Loga- 
rithmus, der trigonometrischen Funktionen usw. abgesehen; allerdings, 
ohne Proportionen, lineare Gleichungen und gelegentliche Quadrate und 
Quadratwurzeln ging es nicht ab. Ich rate dem Leser, der an den 
Formeln hängen bleibt, zunächst über sie hinwegzulesen und aus dem 
Texte selber zum Verständnis der mathematischen Zeichen zu kommen, 
Von Figuren und graphischen Darstellungen habe ich ausgiebigen Gebrauch 
gemacht; auch der in der Handhabung der Koordinaten Ungeübte wird 
die Kurven leicht lesen lernen. 

Die philosophischen Fragen, zu denen die Relativitätstheorie Anlaß 
gibt, werden in diesem Buche nur gestreift; doch ist durchweg ein ganz 
bestimmter erkenntnistheoretischer Standpunkt gewahrt. Ich glaube sicher 
zu sein, daß dieser mit Einsteins eigenen Ansichten in der Hauptsache 
übereinstimmt. Ähnliche Auffassungen vertritt Moritz Schlick in seinem 
schönen Buche »Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre« (i.Band der vorliegenden 
Sammlung, Berlin 19 18, Julius Springer). 

Von anderen Büchern, die ich benutzt habe, nenne ich vor allem 
Ernst Machs klassische »Mechanik« (Leipzig, F. A. Brockhaus, 1883), sodann 
die klargeschriebene Geschichte der Äthertheorien von E. T. Whittaker 
»A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity« (London, Long- 



VIII Vorwort. 

mans, Green and Co., 1910) und die großzügige Darstellung der Re- 
lativitätstheorie von H. Weyl >Raum, Zeit, Materie« (Berlin, Julius Springer, 
19 18). Dieses Werk muß jeder zur Hand nehmen, der tiefer in die 
Lehren Einsteins eindringen will. Die zahlreichen Bücher und Ab- 
handlungen aufzuzählen, aus denen ich mehr oder minder unmittelbar 
geschöpft habe, ist nicht möglich. Auf Literaturangaben habe ich, dem 
Charakter des Werkes entsprechend, vollständig verzichtet. 

Bei der Anfertigung der Abbildungen haben mir Fräulein Dr. Elisa- 
beth Bormann und Herr Dr. Otto Pauli, bei der Herstellung des Re- 
gisters Herr Dr. W. Dehlinger in liebenswürdiger Weise geholfen. Um 
die Richtigkeit der historischen Angaben sicher zu stellen, habe ich Herrn 
Prof. Conrad Müller in Hannover gebeten, die Korrekturen zu lesen; 
dieser ausgezeichnete Kenner der Geschichte der Mathematik und Physik 
hat sich mit Hingabe der großen Mühe unterzogen und mir viele wertvolle 
Ratschläge gegeben. Allen diesen Helfern schulde ich großen Dank, ebenso 
dem Verleger und den Herausgebern, durch deren Mühe und Eifer das 
rasche Erscheinen des Buches in der vorliegenden soliden Ausstattung 
ermöglicht wurde. 

Frankfurt a. M., im Juni 1920. Max Born. 



Vorwort zur zweiten Auflage. 

Die ersten fünf Kapitel, welche die Entwicklung der Physik bis zur 
Einsteinschen Relativitätstheorie darstellen, sind im wesentlichen unverändert 
geblieben. An einigen Stellen, wo in der ersten Auflage nur das Re- 
sultat einer mathematischen Überlegung angegeben wurde, habe ich diese 
selbst eingefügt, weil ich mich nicht auf den Glauben, sondern auf die 
Überzeugung des Lesers stützen möchte. Die Ausführungen über eine 
astronomische Methode zur Feststellung der Bewegung des Sonnensystems 
durch den Äther mit Hilfe der Verfinsterungen der Jupitermonde waren 
in der ersten Auflage nicht korrekt, da ich den Grad der Genauigkeit 
der astronomischen Messungen überschätzt hatte; dieser Abschnitt ist um- 
gearbeitet worden. 

Die letzten Kapitel, die von der Einsteinschen Theorie selbst handeln, 
sind stark erweitert worden; ihr Umfang war im Verhältnis zu der ausführ- 
lichen Vorbereitung zweifellos zu knapp und ihr Inhalt zu spärlich. Die 
Ergänzungen betreffen vor allem die Einsteinsche Dynamik; ich habe den 
Versuch gemacht, ihre Gesetze abzuleiten, ohne aus dem mathematischen 
Rahmen dieses Buches herauszutreten, der nur die elementaren Rechen- 



Vorwort. IX 

Operationen umfaßt. Sodann habe ich die gegen die Relativitätstheorie 
vorgebrachten Einwände ausführlicher besprochen; die Autoren dieser 
sogenannten »Paradoxien« aber habe ich nicht genannt, weil ich die 
Fortsetzung des unfruchtbaren Streites für zwecklos halte. 

Um den Anschein zu vermeiden, daß persönliche Teilnahme sich in 
meine wissenschaftliche Überzeugung eindränge, habe ich das Bild und 
den Lebenslauf Einsteins in der neuen Auflage fortgelassen. 

Beim Lesen der Korrekturen haben mir die Herren Prof. R. Laden- 
burg, Dr. E. Brody, Dr. E. Hauser und Dr. H. Weigt in liebenswürdiger 
Weise geholfen, wofür ich ihnen großen Dank schulde. 

Göttingen, 12. Mai 192 1. Max Born. 



Vorwort zur dritten Auflage. 

Diese Auflage unterscheidet sich von der vorigen abgesehen von einer 
Reihe geringfügiger Änderungen durch die Umarbeitung des Abschnitts 
über die Einsteinsche Dynamik. In dieser war bei der Bildung der Be- 
schleunigung nicht scharf zwischen Zeit und Eigenzeit unterschieden und 
statt der gewöhnlichen Kraft war der Minkowskische kovariante Kraft- 
vektor benützt worden; hierdurch mußte das Verständnis dieses an sich 
schon schwierigen Kapitels noch mehr erschwert werden. Durch Herrn 
Dr. W. Pauli jun. wurde ich auf eine von Lewis und Tolman stammende 
Ableitung der relativistischen Massenformel aufmerksam gemacht, die sich 
in ausgezeichneter Weise dem Rahmen dieses Buches einfügt, da sie ebenso 
wie die hier gewählte Darstellung der Mechanik an den Begriff des Im- 
pulses anknüpft. Das Kapitel über die Einsteinsche Dynamik wurde auf 
Grund dieser Betrachtungsweise umgearbeitet; dadurch werden auch einige 
Änderungen in der Darstellung der gewöhnlichen Mechanik notwendig. 
Ich hoffe, daß diese Neuerung das Verständnis erleichtern wird. 

Ich möchte nicht unterlassen, Herrn Dr. W. Pauli für seinen Rat 
meinen Dank auszusprechen. Sein großes Werk über Relativitätstheorie, 
das als Artikel 19 des V. Bandes der Enzyklopädie der mathematischen 
Wissenschaften vor kurzem erschienen ist, ist mir von großem Nutzen 
gewesen. Ich möchte es allen denen, die tiefer in die Relativitätstheorie 
eindringen wollen, in erster Linie zum Studium empfehlen. 

Beim Lesen der Korrekturen haben mir die Herren Dr. E. Hückel 
und Dr. R. Minkowski in freundlichster Weise geholfen. 

Göttingen, 6. März 1922, Max Born.

Das schönste Glück des denkenden Menschen 

ist, das Erforschliche erforscht zu haben und 

das Unerforschlicjie ruhig zu verehren. 

Goethe. Sprüche in Prosa. 



Einleitung. 

Die Welt ist dem sinnenden Geiste nicht schlechthin gegeben; er 
muß sich ihr Bild aus unzähligen Empfindungen, Erlebnissen, Mitteilungen, 
Erinnerungen, Erfahrungen gestalten. Darum gibt es wohl kaum zwei 
denkende Menschen, deren Weltbild in allen Punkten übereinstimmt. 

Wenn eine Vorstellung in ihren wichtigsten Zügen Gemeingut größerer 
Menschenmassen wird, so entstehen die geistigen Bewegungen, die Re- 
ligionen, philosophische Schulen, wissenschaftliche Systeme heißen; ein 
unentwirrbares Chaos von Meinungen, Glaubenssätzen, Überzeugungen. 
Es scheint schier unmöglich, einen Leitfaden zu finden, durch den diese 
weitverzweigten, sich trennenden und wiedervereinigenden Lehren in eine 
übersehbare Reihe gebracht werden könnten. 

Wohin gehört die Einsteinsche Relativitätstheorie^ deren Darstellung 
dieses kleine Werk gewidmet ist? Ist sie nur ein spezieller Teil der 
Physik oder Astronomie, an sich vielleicht interessant, aber ohne größere 
Bedeutung für die Entwicklung des menschlichen Geistes? Oder ist sie 
wenigstens das Symbol einer besonderen Geistesrichtung, die für unsere 
Zeit charakteristisch ist? Oder bedeutet sie gar selbst eine »Weltanschau- 
ung«? Wir werden diese Fragen zuverlässig erst beantworten können, 
wenn wir den Inhalt der Einsteinschen Lehren kennen gelernt haben. 
Hier aber möge ein Gesichtspunkt gegeben werden, der, wenn auch in 
roher Weise, die Gesamtheit aller Weltanschauungen klassifiziert und der 
Einsteinschen Theorie eine bestimmte Stellung innerhalb einer einheit- 
lichen Auffassung des Weltganzen zuweist. 

Die Welt besteht aus dem Ich und dem Andern, der Innenwelt und 
der Außenwelt. Die Beziehungen dieser beiden Pole sind der Gegenstand 
jeder Religion, jeder Philosophie. Verschieden aber ist die Rolle, die 
jede Lehre dem Ich in der Welt zuweist. Die Wichtigkeit des Ich im 
Weltbilde deucht mir ein Maßstab, an dem man Glaubenslehren, philo- 
sophische Systeme, künstlerische und wissenschaftliche Weltauffassungen 
aufreihen kann, wie Perlen auf einer Schnur. So verlockend es scheint, 

Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. i 



2 Einleitung. 

diesen Gedanken zu verfolgen durch die Geschichte des Geistes, so dürfen 
wir uns doch nicht zu weit von unserm Thema entfernen und wollen 
ihn nur anwenden auf das Teilgebiet menschlicher Geistestätigkeit, in das 
die Einsteinsche Theorie gehört, auf die Naturwissenschaft. 

Das naturwissenschaftliche Denken steht an dem Ende jener Reihe, 
dort, wo das Ich, das Subjekt nur noch eine unbedeutende Rolle spielt, 
und jeder Fortschritt in den Begriffsbildungen der Physik, Astronomie, 
Chemie bedeutet eine Annäherung an das Ziel der Ausschaltung des Ich. 
Dabei handelt es sich' natürlich nicht um den Akt des Erkennen s, der an 
das Subjekt gebunden ist, sondern um das fertige Bild der Natur, dessen 
Untergrund die Vorstellung ist, daß die natürliche Welt unabhängig und 
unbeeinflußt vom Erkenntnisvorgange da ist. 

Die Pforten, durch die die Natur auf uns eindringt, sind die Sinne. 
Ihre Eigenschaften bestimmen den Umfang dessen, was der Empfindung, 
der Anschauung zugänglich ist. Je weiter wir in der Geschichte der 
Naturwissenschaften zurückgehen, um so mehr finden wir das natürliche 
Weltbild bestimmt durch die Sinnesqualitäten. Die ältere Physik wird 
eingeteilt in Mechanik, Akustik, Optik, Wärmelehre: man sieht die Be- 
ziehungen zu den Sinnesorganen, den Bewegungs-, Gehör-, Licht- und 
Wärmeempfindungen. Hier sind die Eigenschaften des Subjekts noch ent- 
scheidend für die Begriffsbildungen. Die Entwicklung der exakten Wissen- 
schaften führt auf deutlichem Pfade von diesem Zustande fort zu einem 
Ziele, das, noch lange nicht erreicht, doch klar vor Augen liegt: Ein 
Bild der Natur zu schaffen, das, an keine Grenzen möglicher Wahrneh- 
mung oder Anschauung gebunden, ein reines Begriffsgebäude darstellt, 
ersonnen zu dem Zwecke, die Summe aller Erfahrungen einheitlich und 
widerspruchslos darzustellen. 

Heute ist die mechanische Kraft ein Abstraktum, das nur noch den 
Namen gemein hat mit dem subjektiven Kraftgefühl; mechanische Masse 
ist nicht mehr ein Attribut der greifbaren Körper, sondern kommt auch 
leeren, nur von Ätherstrahlung erfüllten Räumen zu. Das Reich der hör- 
baren Töne ist eine kleine Provinz geworden in der Welt der unhörbaren 
Schwingungen, physikaHsch von diesen durch nichts unterschieden als 
durch die zufällige Eigenschaft des menschlichen Ohres, gerade nur auf 
ein bestimmtes Intervall von Schwingungszahlen zu reagieren. Die heu- 
tige Optik ist ein spezielles Kapitel aus der Lehre von der Elektrizität 
und dem Magnetismus und behandelt die elektromagnetischen Schwin- 
gungen aller Wellenlängen, von den kürzesten /-Strahlen der radioaktiven 
Substanzen (einhundertmilliontel Millimeter Wellenlänge) über die Rönt- 
genstrahlen, das Ultraviolett, das sichtbare Licht, das Ultrarot bis zu 
den längsten Hertzschen Wellen (viele Kilometer Wellenlänge). In der 
Flut unsichtbaren Lichtes, das das geistige Auge des Physikers umwogt, 
ist das körperliche Auge fast blind; so klein ist der Bereich von Schwin- 
gungen, den es zur Empfindung bringt. Auch die Wärmelehre ist nur 
ein besonderer Teil der Mechanik und der Elektrodynamik; ihre Grund- 



Einleitung. ^ 

begriffe der absoluten Temperatur, der Energie und der Entropie gehören 
zu den subtilsten logischen Gebilden der exakten Wissenschaft und tragen 
nur noch im Namen eine Erinnenmg an das Wärme- oder Kälteerlebnis 
des Subjekts. 

Unhörbare Töne, unsichtbares Licht, unfühlbare Wärme: das ist die 
Welt der Physik, kalt und tot für den, der die lebendige Natur empfinden, 
ihre Zusammenhänge als Harmonie begreifen, ihre Größe anbetend be- 
wundem will. Goethe hat diese starre Welt verabscheut; seine grimmige 
Polemik gegen Newton, in dem er die Verkörperung einer feindlichen 
Naturauffassung sah, beweist, daß es sich hier um mehr handelt, als um 
den sachlichen Streit zweier Forscher über Einzelfragen der Farbenlehre. 
Goethe ist der Repräsentant einer Weltauffassung, die in der oben ent- 
worfenen Skala nach der Bedeutung des Ich ziemlich am entgegengesetzten 
Ende steht wie das Weltbild der exakten Naturwissenschaften. Das Wesen 
der Dichtung ist die Inspiration, die Intuition, das seherische Erfassen 
der Sinnenwelt in symbolischen Formen; die Quelle der poetischen Kraft 
aber ist das Erlebnis, sei es die hell und klar bewußte Empfindung eines 
Sinnenreizes, sei es die kräftig vorgestellte Idee eines Zusammenhanges. 
Das logisch Formale, Begriffliche spielt in dem Weltbilde eines solcher 
Art begabten oder gar begnadeten Geistes keine Rolle; die Welt als 
Summe von Abstraktionen, die nur mittelbar mit dem Erlebnis zusammen- 
hängen, ist ihm fremd. Nur was dem Ich unmittelbar gegeben sein, was 
als Erlebnis gefühlt oder wenigstens als mögliches Erlebnis vorgestellt 
werden kann, ist ihm wirklich und wichtig. So erscheinen dem späten 
Leser, der die Entwicklung der exakten Methoden während des folgenden 
Jahrhunderts überblickt und an den Früchten ihre Kraft und ihren Sinn 
ermißt, Goethes nsitwx historische Arbeiten als Dokumente eines seherischen 
Blickes, als Ausdruck einer wunderbaren Einfühlung in die natürlichen 
Zusammenhänge, seine physikalischen Behauptungen aber als Mißverständ- 
nisse und als fruchtlose Auflehnung gegen eine stärkere Macht, deren 
Sieg schon damals entschieden war. 

Worin besteht nun diese Macht, was sind ihr Schwert und Schild? 

Es ist zugleich eine Anmaßung und ein Verzicht. Die exakten Wissen- 
schaften maßen sich an, objektive Aussagen zu gewinnen, sie verzichten 
aber auf ihre absolute Geltung. Durch diese Formel soll folgender Gegen- 
satz hervorgehoben werden. 

Alle unmittelbaren Erlebnisse führen zu Aussagen, denen man eine 
gewisse absolute Gültigkeit zusprechen muß. Wenn ich eine rote Blume 
sehe, wenn ich Lust oder Schmerz empfinde, so sind das Gegebenheiten, 
an denen zu zweifeln sinnlos ist. Sie gelten unbestreitbar, aber sie gelten 
nur für mich; sie sind absolut, aber sie sind subjektiv. Alles Streben 
menschlicher Erkenntnis zielt darauf hin, aus dem engen Kreis des Ich, 
dem noch engeren des Ich im Augenblicke, herauszukommen zu einer 
Gemeinschaft mit andern geistigen Wesen. Zunächst mit dem Ich, wie 
es zu einer andern Zeit ist, dann mit andern Menschen oder Göttern. 



A Einleitung. 

Alle Religionen, Philosophien, Wissenschaften sind Verfahren, erdacht zu 
dem Zwecke, das Ich zu weiten zu dem Wir. Aber die Wege dazu sind 
verschieden, wir stehen wieder vor dem Chaos der streitenden Lehr- 
meinungen. Doch wir schrecken nicht mehr davor ziurück, sondern ordnen 
sie nach der Bedeutung, die dem Subjekt in dem erstrebten Verstän- 
digungsverfahren zugestanden wird; damit kommen wir auf unser Prinzip 
zurück, denn das fertige Verständigungsverfahren ist ^as Weltbild. Hier 
treten wieder die Gegenpole hervor: 

Die einen wollen nicht verzichten, wollen das Absolute nicht opfern, 
bleiben darum am Ich haften imd schaffen ein Weltbild, das durch kein 
systematisches Verfahren, sondern durch die unbegreifliche Wirkung reli- 
giöser, künstlerischer, poetischer Ausdrucksmittel in fremden Seelen ge- 
weckt werden kann. Hier herrscht der Glaube, die fromme Inbrunst, 
die Liebe brüderlicher Gemeinschaft, oft aber auch Fanatismus, Unduld- 
samkeit, Geisteszwang. 

Die andern opfern das Absolute. Sie entdecken — oft schaudernd 
— die Unübertragbarkeit des seelischen Erlebnisses, sie kämpfen nicht 
mehr um das Unerreichbare und resignieren. Aber sie wollen wenigstens 
im Umkreise des Erreichbaren eine Verständigung schaffen. Darum suchen 
sie nach dem Gemeinsamen des Ich und des andern, fremden Ich, und 
das beste, was da gefunden wurde, sind nicht die Erlebnisse der Seele 
selbst, nicht Empfindungen, Vorstellungen, Gefühle, sondern abstrakte 
Begriffe einfachster Art, Zahlen, logische Formen, kurz die Ausdrucks- 
mittel der exakten Naturwissenschaften. Hier handelt es sich nicht mehr 
um Absolutes. Die Höhe eines Domes wird nicht mehr weihevoll emp- 
funden, sondern in Metern und Zentimetern ausgemessen. Der Ablauf 
eines Lebens wird nicht als rinnende Zeit gefühlt, sondern nach Jahren 
und Tagen gezählt. Relative Maße treten an die Stelle der absoluten 
Eindrücke. Und es entsteht eine enge, einseitige, scharfkantige Welt, 
alles Sinnenreizes, aller Farben und Töne bar. Aber eines hat sie vor 
anderen Weltbildern voraus : ihre Übermittelbarkeit von Geist zu Geist kann 
nicht bezweifelt werden. Man kann sich eben darüber einigen, ob Eisen 
spezifisch schwerer ist als Holz, ob Wasser leichter gefriert als Quecksilber, 
ob der Sirius ein Planet > oder ein Fixstern ist. Mögen Streitigkeiten vor- 
kommen, mag es manchmal aussehen, als wenn eine neue Lehre alle 
alten »Tatsachen« über den Haufen würfe, so fühlt doch der, der die 
Mühe des Eindringens ins Innere dieser Welt nicht gescheut hat, das 
Wachsen der sicher bekannten Gebiete, und während er dies fühlt, 
schwindet das Weh der Einsamkeit der Seele, bildet sich die Brücke zu 
verwandten Geistern. 

So haben wir versucht, das Wesen der naturwissenschaftlichen 
Forschung auszudrücken, und können nun die Einsteinsche Relativitäts- 
theorie in ihren Bereich eingliedern. 

Sie ist zunächst ein reines Erzeugnis jenes Strebens nach der Los- 
lösung vom Ich, von der Empfindung und Anschauung. Wir sprachen 



Einleitung. 5 

von den unhörbaren Tönen, dem unsichtbaren Lichte der Physik; wir 
finden Ähnliches in den Nachbarwissenschaften, in der Chemie, wo die 
Existenz von (radioaktiven) Substanzen behauptet wird, von denen noch 
niemand die kleinste Spur mit irgendwelchen Sinnen direkt wahrgenommen 
hat, oder in der Astronomie, auf die wir unten noch näher einzugehen 
haben. Diese »Erweiterungen der Welt«, wie man sagen könnte, be- 
treffen im wesentlichen Sinnesqualitäten; aber alles spielt sich in dem 
Räume und der Zeit ab, die die Mechanik durch ihren Gründer Newton 
geschenkt bekommen hat. Einsteins Entdeckung besteht nun darin, daß 
dieser Raum und diese Zeit noch ganz und gar am Ich kleben und daß 
das Weltbild der Naturwissenschaft schöner und großartiger wird, wenn 
man auch diese Grundbegriffe einer Relativierung unterwirft. Ist vorher 
der Raum eng mit der subjektiven, absoluten Empfindung der Ausdehnung, 
die Zeit mit der des Lebensablaufs verknüpft, so werden sie nun zu reinen 
Begrifisschemen, der unmittelbaren Anschauung als Ganze gerade so ent- 
zogen, wie der gesamte Wellenlängenbereich der heutigen Optik bis auf 
einen winzigen Ausschnitt der Lichtempfindung unzugänglich ist; aber 
ebenso wie hier gliedern sich Raum und Zeit der Anschauung in die 
physikalischen Begriffssysteme widerspruchslos ein. Damit ist eine Ob- 
jektivierung erreicht, deren Macht sich durch prophetisches Vorhersagen 
von Naturerscheinungen in wunderbarer Weise bewährt hat. Wir werden 
davon im folgenden ausführlich zu reden haben. 

Die Leistung der Einsteinschen Theorie ist also die Relativierung und 
Objektivierung der Begriffe von Raum und Zeit. Sie krönt heute das 
Gebäude des naturwissenschaftlichen Weltbildes. 



I. Geometrie und Kosmologie. 

I. Ursprung der Raum- und Zeitmeßkunst. 

Das physikalische Problem von Raum und Zeit ist die sehr nüchterne 
A-ufgabe, für jedes natürliche Ereignis einen Ort und einen Zeitpunkt 
zahlenmäßig festzulegen, es gewissermaßen im Chaos des Neben- und 
Nacheinander der Dinge wieder auffindbar zu machen. 

Die erste Aufgabe der Menschen war, sich auf der Erde zurechtzu- 
finden; darum wurde die Erdmeßkunst die Quelle der Raumlehre, die 
davon ihren Namen Geometrie bekommen hat. Das Maß der Zeit aber 
entsprang von Anfang an dem regelmäßigen Wechsel von Tag und Nacht, 
der Mondphasen und Jahreszeiten; durch diese aufdringlichen Vorgänge 
wurden die Menschen zuerst veranlaßt, ihre Blicke zu den Sternen zu 
erheben, hier ist die Quelle der Lehre vom Weltall, der Kosmologie. Die 
astronomische Wissenschaft übertrug die auf der Erde erprobten geometri- 
schen Lehren auf die Himmelsräume und bestimmte Entfernungen und 
Bahnen der Gestirne; dafür gab sie den Erdenbewohnern das himmlische 
Maß der Zeit, daß sie Vergangenheit, Gegenwart, Zukunft zu scheiden 
und jedem Ding seinen Platz im Reiche des Chronos zu weisen lernten. 

2. Einheiten für Länge und Zeit. 

Die Grundlage jeder Raum- und Zeitmessung ist die Festlegung der 
Einheit. Eine Längenangabe »so und so viele Meter« bedeutet das Ver- 
hältnis der zu messenden Länge zu der Länge des Meters, eine Zeit- 
angabe »so und so viele Sekunden« das Verhältnis der zu messenden 
Zeit zu der Dauer einer Sekunde. Es handelt sich also immer um Ver- 
hältniszahlen, relative Angaben bezüglich der Einheiten. Diese selbst sind 
in weitem Grade willkürlich und werden nach Gesichtspunkten wie Re- 
produzierbarkeit, Haltbarkeit, Transportfähigkeit usw. gewählt. 

Das Längenmaß der Physik ist das Zentimeter (cm), der hundertste Teil 
eines in Paris aufbewahrten Meterstabes. Dieser sollte ursprünglich in 
einem einfachen Verhältnis zum Erdumfang stehen, nämlich gleich dem 
zehnmillionten Teile des Quadranten sein. Aber neuere Messungen haben 
ergeben, daß das nicht ganz genau stimmt. 

Das Zeitmaß der Physik ist die Sekunde (sec), die in der bekannten 
Beziehung zur Umdrehungsdauer der Erde steht. 



Nullpunkt und Koordinatensystem. 



3. Nullpunkt und Koordinatensystem. 

Will man aber nicht nur Längen und Zeitdauern bestimmen, sondern 
Ort- und Zeitangaben machen, so sind weitere Festsetzungen nötig. Bei 
der Zeit, die wir als eindimensionales Gebilde vorstellen, genügt die An- 
gabe eines Nullpunkts. Unsere Historiker zählen die Jahre von Christi Ge- 
burt an; die Astronomen wählen je nach 
dem Ziele ihrer Untersuchung andere Null- 
punkte, die sie Epochen nennen. Sind 
die Einheit und der Nullpunkt festgelegt, 
so ist damit jedes Ereignis durch Angabe 
einer Zahl auffindbar gemacht. 

In der Geometrie im engeren Sinne, 
der Ortsbestimmung auf der Erde, müssen 
zur Festlegung eines Punktes zwei An- 
gaben gemacht werden. »Mein Haus liegt 
in der Taunustraße« genügt nicht, es zu 
finden, ich muß auch noch die Haus- 
nummer nennen. In vielen amerikani- 
schen Städten sind die Straßen selbst 
numeriert; die Adresse Nr. 25, 13. Straße 
besteht dann aus zwei Zahlenangaben. 

Sie ist genau das, was die Mathematiker eine Koordinatenbestimnmng 
nennen. Man überzieht die Erdoberfläche mit einem Netze sich kreu- 
zender Linien, die numeriert sind, oder deren Lage durch eine Maßzahl, 
Entfernung oder Winkel, gegen eine feste Null-Linie bestimmt wird. 

Die Geographen verwenden gewöhnlich die geographische Länge (öst- 
lich Greenwich) und (nördliche, südHche) Breite (Abb. i); diese Bestim- 






Abb. 2. 



Abb. 3. 



mungen enthalten zugleich die Festlegung der Null-Linien, von denen aus 
die Koordinaten zu zählen sind, nämlich bei der geographischen Länge 
der Meridian von Greenwich, bei der Breite der Äquator. Bei Unter- 
suchungen über ebene Geometrie bedient man sich gewöhnfich recht- 
zvinkliger Koordinaten (Abb. 2) x^ y^ die die Abstände von zwei aufein-

ander senkrechten -»Koordinatenachsen«, bedeuten, oder gelegentlich auch 
schiefwiiikliger Koordinaten (Abb. 3), Polarkoordinaten (Abb. 4) u. a. Ist 
das Koordinatensystem gegeben, so kann man jeden Ort durch Angabe 
zweier Zahlen auffinden. 

Ganz ebenso braucht man zur Festlegung von Orten im Räume drei 
Koordinaten, die am einfachsten wieder rechtwinklig gewählt und mit 
Xj y, z bezeichnet werden (Abb. 5).

4. Die geometrischen Axiome. 

Die antike Geometrie als Wissenschaft hat weniger die Frage der 
Ortsbestimmung auf der Erdoberfläche, als das Problem der Bestimmung 
der Größe und Form von Flächenstücken, Raumfiguren und deren Gesetze 
behandelt; man spürt den Ursprung aus der Feldmeßkunst und der Archi- 
tektur. Darum kam sie auch ohne den Koordinatenbegriff aus. Die geo- 
metrischen Sätze behaupten in erster Linie Eigenschaften von Dingen, 
die Punkt, Gerade, Ebene heißen. In dem klassischen Kanon der grie- 
chischen Geometrie, dem Werke Euklids (300 v. Chr.), werden diese 
Dinge nicht weiter definiert, sondern nur bezeichnet oder beschrieben; hier 
erfolgt also ein Appell an die Anschauung. Was eine gerade Linie ist, 
mußt du schon wissen, wenn du Geometrie treiben willst; stelle dir die 
Kante eines Hauses vor oder die gespannte Meßkette des Feldmessers, 
abstrahiere von allem Materiellen: und du behältst die Gerade. Nun 
werden Gesetze aufgestellt, die zwischen diesen Gebilden der abstrakten 
Anschauung gelten sollen, und zwar ist die große Entdeckung der Grie- 
chen, daß man nur eine kleine Anzahl dieser Sätze anzunehmen braucht, 
um dann alle andern mit logischem Zwange als richtig zugeben zu müssen. 
Diese an die Spitze gestellten Sätze sind die Axiome\ ihre Richtigkeit 
ist nicht beweisbar, sie entspringen nicht der Logik, sondern anderen 
Quellen der Erkenntnis. Welches diese Quellen sind, darüber haben alle 
Philosophien der folgenden Jahrhunderte Theorien entwickelt. Die wissen- 
schaftliche Geometrie selber hat die Axiome bis ans Ende des 18. Jahr- 
hunderts als gegeben hingenommen und darauf ihr rein deduktives System 
von Lehrsätzen getürmt. 



Das ptolemäische Weltsystem. — Das kopemikanische Weltsystem. 



Wir werden es nicht umgehen können, die Frage nach der Bedeutung 
der mit Punkt, Gerade usw. bezeichneten Elementargebilde und nach 
dem Erkenntnisgrund der geometrischen Axiome ausführlich zu erörtern. 
Hier aber wollen wir uns auf den Standpunkt stellen, daß über diese 
Dinge Klarheit herrscht; wir operieren vorläufig mit den geometrischen 
Begriffen, wie wir es in der Schule gelernt haben (oder wenigstens hätten 
lernen sollen) und wie es unzählige Generationen von Menschen unbe- 
denklich getan haben. Die Anschaulichkeit zahlreicher geometrischer 
Sätze und die Brauchbarkeit des ganzen Systems zur Orientierung in der 
realen Welt mögen als Rechtfertigung genügen. 

5. Das ptolemäische Weltsystem. 

Der Himmel erscheint dem Auge als eine mehr oder minder flache 
Kuppel, an der die Gestirne angeheftet sind; die ganze Kuppel aber dreht 
sich im Laufe eines Tages um eine Achse, deren Lage am Himmel durch 
den Polarstem bezeichnet wird. Solange dieser Augenschein als Wirk- 
lichkeit galt, war eine Übertragung der Geometrie von der Erde auf den 
Weltenraum überflüssig und wurde tatsächlich nicht vollzogen; denn 
Längen, Entfernungen, die mit irdischen Einheiten meßbar wären, sind 
nicht vorhanden, zur Bezeichnung der Stellungen der Gestirne genügt die 
Angabe der scheinbaren Winkel, die die Blickrichtung vom Beobachter 
nach dem Gestirne mit dem Horizont und einer andern, geeignet ge- 
wählten Ebene bildet. In diesem Stadium der Erkenntnis ist die Erdober- 
fläche der ruhende, ewige Grund des All; die Worte »oben« und »unten« 
haben einen absoluten Sinn, und wenn dichterische Phantasie oder philo- 
sophische Spekulation die Höhe des Himmels, die Tiefe des Tartarus 
abzuschätzen unternehmen, so braucht die Bedeutung dieser Begriffe mit 
keinem Worte erläutert zu werden, das unmittelbare Erlebnis der An- 
schauung liefert sie ohne Spekulation. Hier schöpft die naturwissen- 
schaftliche Begriffsbildung noch ganz aus der Fülle der subjektiven Ge- 
gebenheiten. Das nach Ptolemäus (150 n. Chr.) benannte Weltsystem 
ist die wissenschaftliche Formulierung dieses geistigen Zustandes ; es kennt 
bereits eine Menge von feineren Tatsachen über die Bewegung der Sonne, 
des Mondes, der Planeten und es bewältigt sie theoretisch mit beträcht- 
lichem Erfolge, doch hält es fest an der absolut ruhenden Erde, um die 
die Gestirne in unmeßbaren Entfernungen kreisen. Ihre Bahnen werden 
als Kreise und Epizykeln nach den Gesetzen der irdischen Geometrie 
bestimmt, doch wird dadurch nicht eigentlich der Weltraum der Geo- 
metrie unterworfen; denn die Bahnen liegen gleich Schienen auf den 
kristallenen Schalen befestigt, die hintereinander geschichtet den Himmel 
bedeuten. 

6. Das kopemikanische Weltsystem. 

Man weiß, daß bereits griechische Denker die Kugelgestalt der Erde 
entdeckten und die ersten Schritte vom ptolemäischen , geozentrischen 



lO Geometrie und Kosmologie. 



Weltsysteme zu höheren Abstraktionen wagten. Aber erst lange nach 
dem Absterben der griechischen Kultur, bei andern Völkern anderer 
Länder, wurde die Erdkugel physikalische Wirklichkeit. Das ist die erste 
ganz große Abwendung vom Augenschein und zugleich die erste ganz 
große Relativierung. Wieder sind Jahrhunderte seit jener Wende ver- 
gangen, und was damals unerhörte Entdeckung war, ist heute Schulweis- 
heit für kleine Kinder. Darum ist es schwer, sich klar zu machen, was 
es dem Denken bedeutete, als die Begriffe »oben« und > unten« ihren abso- 
luten Sinn verloren und das Recht des Antipoden anerkannt werden 
mußte, die Richtung im Räume oben zu nennen, die hier unten heißt. 
Aber als die erste Erdumsegelung gelungen war, wurde die Sache so 
handgreiflich, daß jeder Widerspruch verstummte. Aus diesem Grunde 
bot auch die Entdeckung des Globus keinen Anlaß zum Kampfe zwischen 
objektiver und subjektiver Weltauffassung, zwischen Naturforschung und 
Kirche. Dieser Kampf entbrannte erst, als Köper nikus (1543) die 
Erde ihrer zentralen Stellung im Weltall entsetzte und das heliozentrische 
Weltsystem schuf. 

Hier liegt an sich kaum eine höhere Relativierung vor, aber die Be- 
deutung der Entdeckung für die Entwicklung des menschlichen Geistes 
liegt darin, daß die Erde, die Menschheit, das einzelne Ich entthront 
werden. Die Erde wird ein Trabant der Sonne und schleppt die auf ihr 
wimmelnde Menschheit im Welträume herum, neben ihr kreisen ähnliche, 
gleichwertige Planeten : der Mensch der Astronomie ist nicht mehr wichtig, 
höchstens für sich selbst. Aber noch weiter: alle diese Ungeheuerlich- 
keiten fließen nicht aus groben Tatsachen (wie es etwa eine Erdumsege- 
lung ist), sondern aus für jene Zeit feinen, subtilen Beobachtungen, 
schwierigen Rechnungen über Planetenbahnen, jedenfalls lauter Beweis- 
gründen, die weder jedermann zugänglich noch für das alltägliche Leben 
von irgendwelcher Wichtigkeit sind. Augenschein, Anschauung, heilige 
und profane Überlieferung sprechen gegen die neue Lehre. An die Stelle 
der sichtbaren Sonnenscheibe setzt diese einen unvorstellbar riesigen 
Feuerball, an die Stelle der freundlichen Himmelslichter ebensolche Feuer- 
bälle in unbegreiflichen Fernen oder erdenartige Kugeln, die fremdes Licht 
widerstrahlen, und alle sichtbaren Maße sollen Täuschung sein, Wahrheit 
aber unermeßliche Entfernungen, rasende Geschwindigkeiten. Und trotz- 
dem mußte die neue Lehre siegen; denn ihre Kraft war der heiße Wille 
jedes denkenden Menschen, alle Dinge der natürlichen Welt, und seien 
sie noch so bedeutungslos für das menschliche Dasein, als eine gesetz- 
mäßige Einheit zu erfassen, um sie im Denken festhalten und andern 
mitteilen zu können. Bei diesem Prozesse, der das Wesen der natur- 
wissenschaftHchen Forschung ausmacht, scheut der Geist nicht davor 
zurück, die sinnfälligsten Tatsachen der Anschauung zu bezweifeln oder 
als Täuschung zu erklären, aber er greift lieber zu den höchsten Abstrak- 
tionen, ehe er eine sichere Tatsache, sei sie noch so unbedeutend, aus 
dem Naturbilde ausschließt. Darum mußte auch die Kirche, damals die 



Der Ausbau der kopemikanischen Lehre. 1 1 



Trägerin der herrschenden subjektiven Weltanschauung, die Kopernika- 
nische Lehre verfolgen, darum mußte Galilei vor das Ketzergericht. 
Nicht so sehr die Widersprüche gegen überlieferte Dogmen, als die ver- 
änderte Einstellung gegenüber den seelischen Vorgängen haben diesen 
Kampf entfesselt; wenn das Erlebnis der Seele, die Anschauung der Dinge, 
in der Natur nichts mehr bedeuten sollte, so konnte eines Tages auch 
das religiöse Erlebnis vom Zweifel getrofifen werden. So weit selbst die 
kühnsten Denker jener Zeit von religiöser Skepsis entfernt waren, die 
Kirche witterte doch den Feind. 

Von der großen Relativierungstat des Kopernikus stammen alle die 
unzähligen ähnlichen, aber kleineren Relativierungen der wachsenden 
Naturwissenschaft, bis Einsteins Leistung wieder würdig an die Seite des 
großen Vorbildes tritt. 

Nun müssen wir aber mit wenigen Worten den Kosmos schildern, 
wie ihn Kopernikus entworfen hat. 

Da ist zuerst zu sagen, daß die Begriffe und Gesetze der irdischen 
Geometrie ohne weiteres auf den Weltenraum übertragen werden. An 
Stelle der noch flächenhaft vorgestellten Zykeln der ptolemäischen Welt 
treten nun wirkliche Bahnen im Räume, deren Ebenen verschiedene Stel- 
lungen haben können. Das Zentrum des Weltsystems ist die Sonne; 
um sie ziehen die Planeten ihre Kreise, einer von ihnen ist die Erde, 
die sich selbst um ihre Achse dreht und um die der Mond wieder auf 
einer Kreisbahn läuft. Draußen aber in ungeheuren Entfernungen sind 
die Fixsterne Sonnen gleich der unserigen, im Räume ruhend. Koper- 
nikus' konstruktive Leistung ist der Nachweis, daß bei dieser Annahme 
der Anbhck des Himmels alle jene Erscheinungen zeigen muß, die das 
überlieferte Weltsystem nur durch verwickelte und künstliche Hypothesen 
erklären konnte. Der Wechsel von Tag und Nacht, die Jahreszeiten, die 
Erscheinungen der Mondphasen, die verschlungenen Planetenbahnen, alles 
wird auf einmal durchsichtig, verständlich und relativ einfachen Berech- 
nungen zugänglich. 

7. Der Ausbau der kopemikanischen Lehre. 

Die Kreisbahnen des Kopernikus genügten bald den Beobachtungen 
nicht mehr; offenbar sind die wirklichen Bahnen wesentlich verwickelter. 
Es war nun entscheidend für den Wert der neuen Weltauffassung, ob 
wieder künstliche Konstruktionen wie die Epizykeln des ptolemäischen 
Systems notwendig würden, oder ob die Verbesserung der Bahnberech- 
nung ohne Komplikationen gelang. Keplers (161 8) unsterbliches Ver- 
dienst ist es, die einfachen und durchsichtigen Gesetze der Planeten- 
bahnen gefunden und dadurch das kopernikanische System in einer Krisis 
gerettet zu haben. Die Bahnen sind zwar nicht Kreise um die Sonne, 
aber dem Kreise nah verwandte Kurven, Ellipsen, in deren einem Brenn- 
punkte die Sonne steht. Wie dieses Gesetz die Form der Bahnen in 



12 Geometrie und Kosmologie. 



einfachster Weise regelt, so bestimmen die beiden andern Gesetze Keplers 
die Größe der Bahnen und die Geschwindigkeiten, mit denen sie durch- 
laufen werden. 

Keplers Zeitgenosse Galilei {1610) richtete das neu erfundene Fem- 
rohr auf den Sternhimmel und entdeckte die Jupitermonde; in ihnen er- 
kannte er ein verkleinertes Abbild des Planetensystems, sah des Kopemikus 
Ideen als optische Wirklichkeiten. Galileis größeres Verdienst aber ist 
die Entwicklung der Prinzipien der Mechanik, deren Anwendung auf die 
Planetenbahnen durch Newton (1687) die Vollendung des kopernika- 
nischen Weltsystems herbeiführte. 

Kopemikus' Kreise und Keplers Ellipsen sind das, was die heutige 
Wissenschaft eine kinematische oder phoronomische Darstellung der Bahnen 
nennt, nämlich eine mathematische Formulierung der Bewegungen ohne 
Angabe der Ursachen und Zusammenhänge, die gerade diese Bewegungen 
hervorbringen. Die kausale Fassung von Bewegungsgesetzen ist der In- 
halt der von Galilei begründeten Dynamik oder Kinetik. Newton hat 
diese Lehre auf die Bewegungen der Himmelskörper angewandt und durch 
eine höchst geniale Interpretation von Keplers Gesetzen den Ursachen-; 
begriff als mechanische Kraft in die Astronomie eingeführt. Das New- 
tonsche Gesetz der allgemeinen Anziehungskraft oder Gravitation bewies 
seine Überlegenheit über die älteren Theorien durch die Erklärung aller 
Abweichungen von Keplers Gesetzen, die sogenannten Bahnstörungen, die 
durch die verfeinerte Beobachtungskunst inzwischen zutage gefördert 
worden waren. 

Diese dynamische Auffassung der Bewegungs Vorgänge im Welten- 
raume bedingte nun aber sogleich eine schärfere Fassung der Voraus- 
setzungen über Raum und Zeit. Bei Newton treten diese Axiome zum 
ersten Male ausdrücklich formuliert in Erscheinung; man darf daher die 
bis zu Einsteins Auftreten geltenden Sätze als Newtons Lehre von Raum 
und Zeit bezeichnen. Zu ihrem Verständnisse ist es unumgänglich, die 
Grundbegriffe der Mechanik klar zu übersehen, und zwar von einem in 
den elementaren Lehrbüchern gewöhnlich vernachlässigten Standpunkte, 
der die Frage nach der Relativität in den Vordergrund rückt. Wir wer- 
den daher zunächst die einfachsten Tatsachen, Definitionen und Gesetze 
der Mechanik zu erörtern haben. 



II. Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 

I. Gleichgewicht und KraftbegrifF. 

Die Mechanik hat historisch ihren Ausgang von der Gleichgewichts- 
lehre oder Statik genommen; auch logisch ist dieser Aufbau der natür- 
lichste. 

Der Grundbegriff der Statik ist die Kraft\ er stammt von dem sub- 
jektiven Gefühl der Anstrengung beim Ausführen einer körperlichen Ar- 
beit. Von zwei Männern ist der der kräftigere, der den schwereren Stein 
heben, den steiferen Bogen spannen kann. In diesem Kraftmaße, mit dem 
Odysseus den Freiern sein Recht bewies und das in den alten Helden- 
liedern überhaupt eine große Rolle spielt, liegt bereits der Keim der Ob- 
jektivierung des subjektiven Anstrengungsgefühls. Der nächste Schritt ist 
die Wahl einer Einheit der Kraft und die Messung aller Kräfte im Ver- 
hältnis zu der Einheitskraft, also die Relativierung des Kraftbegriffs. Das 
Gewicht^ als die aufdringlichste Kraft, die alle irdischen Dinge nach 
unten zieht, bot die Krafteinheit in bequemer Form: ein Stück Metall, 
das durch irgendeinen staatlichen oder priesterlichen Akt als Gewichts- 
einheit bestimmt wurde. Heute sind es internationale Kongresse, die die 
Einheiten festsetzen. Als Gewichtseinheit gilt in der Technik das Ge- 
wicht eines bestimmten Stückes Platin in Paris; diese Gramm (g) ge- 
nannte Einheit wollen wir bis auf weiteres benützen. Das Instrument 
zum Vergleichen der Gewichte verschiedener Körper ist die Wage. 

Zwei Körper sind gewichtsgleich, gleich schwer, wenn sie, auf die 
beiden Wagschalen gelegt, das Gleichgewicht der Wage nicht stören. 
Legt man zwei auf diese Weise gefundene gleich schwere Körper beide 
in die eine Wagschale, in die andere aber einen Körper, der den beiden 
das Gleichgewicht hält, so hat dieser das doppelte Gewicht wie jeder der 
beiden andern. Auf diese Weise fortfahrend verschafft man sich, von der 
Gewichtseinheit ausgehend, einen Gewichtssatz, mit dessen Hilfe das 
Gewicht jedes Körpers in bequemer Weise ermittelt werden kann. 

Es ist hier nicht unsere Aufgabe, auszuführen, wie mit diesen Hilfs- 
mitteln die einfachen Gesetze der Statik fester Körper, etwa die Hebel- 
gesetze, gefunden und gedeutet werden. Wir bringen nur so viele Begriffe, 
als zum Verständnisse der Relativitätstheorie unerläßHch sind. 

Andere Kräfte treten dem primitiven Menschen außer in seiner eigenen 
Körperkraft oder der seiner Haustiere vor allem bei den Vorgängen ent- 
gegen, die wir heute die elastischen nennen. Dazu gehört die Kraft, die 



lA Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 

ein Bogen, eine Armbrust zum Spannen erfordert. Man kann diese nun 
leicht mit Gewichten vergleichen. Will man z. B. die Kraft messen, die 
nötig ist, um eine Spiralfeder (Abb. 6) um ein bestimmtes Stück zu dehnen, 

so probiere man aus, welches Gewicht man 

I l anhängen muß, damit gerade bei dieser 

Dehnung Gleichgewicht herrscht; dann ist 
die Federkraft gleich der des Gewichts, 
nur daß sie nach oben, das Gewicht aber 
nach unten zieht. Hierbei wird stillschwei- 
gend das Prinzip verwendet, daß Kraft und 
Gegenkraft (actio und reactio) im Gleich- 
gewichte einander gleich sind. 

Stört man ein solches Gleichgewicht 
durch Schwächung oder Fortnahme der 
einen Kraft, so tritt Bewegung ein. Das 

.,, , gehobene Gewicht fällt herab, wenn die 

Abb. 6. ° ... 

stützende Hand, die die Gegenkraft leistet, 

losläßt; der Pfeil fliegt davon, wenn der Schütze die Sehne des ge- 
spannten Bogens freigibt. Kraft erzeugt Bewegung. Das ist der Aus- 
gangspunkt der Dynamik^ die nach den Gesetzen dieses Vorganges sucht. 

2. Bewegungslehre. Geradlinige Bewegung. 

Zuvor ist es notwendig, den Begriff der Bewegung selber einer Analyse 
zu unterwerfen. Die exakte, mathematische Beschreibung der Bewegung 
eines Punktes besteht darin, daß man von Augenblick zu Augenblick an- 
gibt, an welchem Orte relativ zu dem im voraus gewählten Koordinaten- 
system er sich befindet. Der Mathematiker benützt hierzu Formeln; wir 
wollen diese, nicht jedem geläufige Art, Gesetze und Zusammenhänge 
darzustellen, nach Möglichkeit vermeiden und bedienen uns statt dessen 
einer graphischen Darstellungsmethode. Diese möge an dem einfachsten 
Beispiele, der Bewegung eines Punktes in einer Geraden, erläutert werden. 
Auf der Geraden sei ein Nullpunkt gewählt; die Längeneinheit sei, wie 
in der Physik üblich, das cm. Der bewegliche Punkt habe in dem Augen- 
blicke, wo wir die Betrachtung beginnen und den wir als den Zeitmoment 
/ = o bezeichnen, den Abstand :r = i cm vom Nullpunkte ; während i sec 
sei er um */2 cm nach rechts gerückt, so daß für / = i der Abstand vom 
Nullpunkt den Wert rt: = i,5cm hat; in der nächsten Sekunde rücke er 
um denselben Betrag nach x=^ 2 cm, usw. Die folgende kleine Tabelle 
gibt die zu den Zeiten t gehörigen Entfernungen x wieder. 

^1 o I 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.... 
X \ I 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 4 4,5 5 ... . 

Denselben Zusammenhang sehen wir in den aufeinander folgenden 
Bildern der Abb. 7 dargestellt, wo der bewegliche Punkt als kleiner Kreis

auf der Entfemungsskala angedeutet ist. Statt nun lauter kleine Figuren 
übereinander zu zeichnen, kann man eine einzige Figur entwerfen, in der 
X und / als Koordinaten auftreten (Abb. 8) ; damit gewinnt man überdies 
den Vorteil, daß der Ort des Punktes nicht nur für die vollen Sekunden, 
sondern auch für alle Zwischenzeiten dargestellt werden kann, man braucht 
dazu nur die in der ersten Figur markierten Lagen durch eine Kurve zu 
verbinden. In unserm Falle ist das offenbar eine gerade Linie; der Punkt 
rückt nämlich in gleichen Zeiten um gleiche Strecken vor, die Koordinaten 
X, t ändern sich also in gleichem Verhältnisse (proportional), und es ist 
evident, daß das Bild dieses Gesetzes eine Gerade ist. Man nennt eine 



t^6

t--h-

solche Bewegung eine gleichförmige. Als Geschwindigkeit v der Bewegung

nötigten Zeit, in Zeichen:

Bei unserm Beispiele legt der Punkt in jeder sec den Weg '/^ cm zurück, 
die Geschwindigkeit bleibt also immer dieselbe und beträgt ^^ cm pro sec. 

Die Einheit der Geschwindigkeit ist durch diese Definition schon fest- 
gelegt; sie ist diejenige Geschwindigkeit, bei der der bewegliche Punkt 
in I sec i cm zurücklegt. Man sagt, es ist eine abgeleitete Einheit, und 
man bezeichnet sie, ohne Einführung eines neuen Wertes mit cm pro sec, 
oder cm/sec. Um auszudrücken, daß die Geschwindigkeitsmessung sich 
nach der Formel (i) auf Längen und Zeitmessungen zurückführen läßt, 
sagt man auch, die Geschwindigkeit habe die •* Dimension <f. Länge dividiert

Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 



SO läßt sich die Einheit der Größe durch die der Länge, der Zeit und 
des Gewichtes, etwa cm, sec und g, sofort ausdrücken. 

Bei großen Geschwindigkeiten ist der in der Zeit / zurückgelegte Weg x 
groß, also verläuft die Bildgerade flach gegen die Jtr-Achse; je kleiner die 
Geschwindigkeit ist, um so steiler steigt sie an. Ein ruhender Punkt hat 

die Geschwindigkeit Null und 
wird in unserm Diagramm durch 
eine zur /-Achse parallele Ge- 
rade dargestellt; denn die 
Punkte dieser Geraden haben 
für alle Zeiten t denselben 
Wert von x (Abb. 9, a). 

Wenn ein Punkt erst ruht, 
aber dann in einem Augen- 
blicke plötzlich eine Geschwin- 
digkeit bekommt und mit dieser 
sich weiter bewegt, bekommen 
wir das Bild ein6s geknickten 
>A' Geradenzuges, dessen erster 
Teil vertikal ist (Abb. 9, b). 
Ähnliche geknickte Geraden- 
züge stellen die Fälle dar, wo ein zuerst nach rechts oder links gleich- 
förmig bewegter Punkt plötzlich seine Geschwindigkeit ändert (Abb. 9, c, d). 
Ist die Geschwindigkeit vor der plötzlichen Änderung v^ (etwa 
= 3 cm/sec), nachher v^ (etwa = 5 cm/sec), so ist die Geschwindigkeits-

zunähme v^ — v^ (also = 5 — 3 = 2 cm/sec). Wenn v^ kleiner als t'^ ist 
(etwa v^ = i cm/sec), so ist v^ — v^ negativ (nämlich =1 — 3 = — 2 cm/sec) 
und das bedeutet offenbar, daß der bewegte Punkt plötzlich verzögert 
wird.

Erfährt ein Punkt sehr oft hintereinander momentane Geschwindig- 
keitsänderungen, so ist das Bild seiner Bewegung ein Vieleck- oder Poly- 
gonzug (Abb. 10). 

Folgen die Änderungen der Geschwindigkeit immer schneller aufein- 
ander und werden dabei hinreichend klein, so wird der Polygonzug bald 
nicht mehr von einer krummen Linie zu unterscheiden' sein; er stellt 
dann eine Bewegung dar, deren Geschwindigkeit fortwährend wechselt, 
die also ungleichförmig, beschleunigt oder verzögert, ist (Abb. 11). 

Ein exaktes Maß der Geschwindigkeit und ihrer Änderung, der Be- 
schleunigung, kann man in diesem Falle nur mit den Methoden der In- 
finitesimalrechnung gewinnen; für uns genügt es, die kontinuierliche Kurve 
durch ein Polygon ersetzt zu denken, dessen gerade Seiten gleichförmige 
Bewegungen mit bestimmter Geschwindigkeit darstellen. Die Knicke des 
Polygons, d. h. die plötzlichen Geschwindigkeitsänderungen, mögen in 

gleichen Zeitabständen, etwa t = — sec, aufeinander folgen.

Wenn sie überdies alle gleich groß sind, heißt die Bewegung >gleich-

Größe w^ und wenn n in der Sekunde erfolgen, so ist die gesamte Ge- 
schwindigkeitsänderung pro sec (Abb. 12).

Das bedeutet, die in gleichen Zeiten zurückgelegten Wege verhalten 
sich wie die Quadrate der Zeiten. Beträgt z. B. die Beschleunigung

der 2. Sekunde den Weg 5 • 2* = 5 • 4 = 20 m, in der 3. Sekunde den 
Weg 5'3'' = 5*9 = 45na zurück, usw. Dieser Zusammenhang wird 
durch eine krumme Linie in der ^ /-Ebene, Parabel genannt, dargestellt 
(Abb. 13). Vergleicht man diese Figur mit der Abb. 12, so sieht man, 
wie der Polygonzug näherungsweise die stetig gekrümmte Parabel dar- 
stellt; in beiden Figuren ist die Beschleunigung ^ = 10 gewählt, und 
diese bestimmt das Aussehen der Kurve, während die Längen- und Zeit- 
Einheiten unwesentlich sind.

Man kann den Begriff der Beschleunigung auch auf nicht gleichförmig 
beschleunigte Bewegungen anwenden, indem man statt i sec eine so kurze 
Zeit der Beobachtung zugrunde legt, daß während derselben die Be- 
wegung als gleichförmig beschleunigt betrachtet werden kann. Dann ist 
die Beschleunigung selber fortwährend veränderlich. 

Alle diese Definitionen werden erst streng und gleichzeitig bequem zu 
handhaben, wenn man den Unterteilungsprozeß in kleine Abschnitte, für 
die die betrachtete Größe als konstant gelten darf, genau studiert; man 
kommt dabei auf den Begriff des Grenzwertes, der den Ausgangspunkt 
der Differentialrechnung bildet. Historisch war tatsächlich die Bewegungs- 
lehre dasjenige Problem, zu dessen Bewältigung Newton die Differential- 
rechnung und ihre Umkehrung, die Integralrechnung, erfunden hat. 

Die Bewegungslehre (Kinematik, Phoronomie) ist die Vorstufe zur 
eigentlichen Mechanik der Kräfte oder, Dynamik; sie ist offenbar eine 
Art Geometrie der Bewegung. In der Tat wird in unserer graphischen 
Darstellung jede Bewegung durch ein geometrisches Gebilde in der Ebene 
mit den Koordinaten x^ t dargestellt. Dabei handelt es sich um etwas 
mehr als ein bloßes Gleichnis; gerade in der Relativitätstheorie gewinnt 
die Einführung der Zeit als Koordinate neben den räumlichen Abmes- 
sungen eine prinzipielle Bedeutung.

3. Bewegung in der Ebene. 

Wollen wir nun die Bewegung eines Punktes in einer Ebene studieren, 
so läßt sich unser Darstellungsverfahren ohne weiteres übertragen. Man 
nimmt in der Ebene ein ^^-Koordinatensystem und errichtet senkrecht 
auf ihr die /-Achse (Abb. 14). Dann entspricht einer geradlinigen und 
gleichförmigen Bewegung in der xy-Ebene eine gerade Linie im xyt- 
Raume; denn wenn man die Punkte der Geraden, die den Zeitmarken 
/ = o, I, 2, 3, ... entsprechen, auf die ^jv-Ebene projiziert, sieht man, 
daß die örtliche Verschiebung auf gerader Linie und in gleichmäßigen 
Intervallen vor sich geht. 





Abb. 14. 



Abb. 15. 



Jede nicht geradlinige und gleichförmige Bewegung heißt beschleunigt^ 
z. B. auch dann, wenn eine krumme Bahn mit konstanter Geschwindig- 
keit durchlaufen wird; dann ändert sich zwar nicht die Größe aber die 
Richtung der Geschwindigkeit. Eine beschleunigte Bewegung wird durch 
eine beliebige Kurve im xyt-KzMTne, dargestellt (Abb. 15); die Projektion 
dieser Kurve auf die ^j;- Ebene ist die ebene Bahn. Man berechnet 
die Geschwindigkeit und die Beschleunigung wieder, indem man die 
Kurve durch einen sich eng anschließenden Polygonzug ersetzt denkt; 
an jeder Ecke dieses Polygons ändert sich nicht nur die Größe der Ge- 
schwindigkeit, sondern auch ihre Richtung. Eine genauere Analyse des 
Beschleunigungsbegriffes würde uns zu weit führen; es genügt zu sagen, 
daß man am besten den bewegten Punkt auf die Koordinatenachsen x^ y 
projiziert und die geradlinige Bewegung dieser beiden Projektionspunkte 
oder, was dasselbe ist, die zeitliche Änderung der Koordinaten x^ y 
selber verfolgt. Auf diese Projektionsbewegungen lassen sich nun die 
oben für geradlinige Bewegungen gegebenen Begriffsbestimmungen an- 
wenden; man erhält zwei Geschwindigkeitskotnponenten Vx^ Vy und zwei 
Beschleunigungskomponenten bx, by^ die zusammen den Geschwindigkeits- 
bzw. Beschleunigungszustand des bewegten Punktes festlegen. 



Bewegung in der Ebene. — Kreisbewegung. 



21 



Bei einer ebenen Bewegung (und ebenso bei einer räumlichen) sind also 
Geschwindigkeit und Beschleunigung gerichtete Größen (Vektoren) ; sie haben 
eine bestimmte Richtung und einen bestimmten Betrag. Letzteren kann 
man aus den Komponenten berechnen. So 
erhält man z. B. die Geschwindigkeit nach 
Richtung und Größe als Diagonale des 
Rechtecks mit den Seiten Vx und Vy (Abb. 
i6), ihr Betrag ist also nach dem Pythago- 
räischen Lehrsatze

Abb. 16. 



Nur einen Fall wollen wir etwas näher betrachten, nämlich die Be- 
wegung eines Punktes auf einer Kreisbahn mit konstanter Geschwindigkeit 
(Abb. 17); nach dem oben Gesagten ist das eine beschleunigte Bewegung, 
da die Richtung der Geschwindigkeit fortwährend wechselt. Wäre die Be- 
wegung unbeschleunigt, so liefe der bewegte Punkt von A aus geradlinig 
mit der Geschwindigkeit v vorwärts. In Wirklichkeit aber soll der Punkt 




Abb. 17. 



auf dem Kreise bleiben, er muß also eine auf den Mittelpunkt M hin 
gerichtete Zusatzgeschwindigkeit oder Beschleunigung haben; man nennt 
diese Zentripetalbeschleunigung, Sie bewirkt, daß die Geschwindigkeit in 
einem Nachbarpunkte B^ der nach der kurzen Zeit / erreicht wird, eine 
andere Richtung hat wie im Punkte A. Wir zeichnen nun in einer Neben- 
figur (Abb. 17) die Geschwindigkeiten in A und B von einem beliebigen 
Punkte C aus nach Größe und Richtung hin; die Größe v ist dieselbe, 
da der Kreis mit konstanter Geschwindigkeit durchlaufen werden soll, 
aber die Richtung ist verschieden. Verbinden wir die Endpunkte D und E 



22 



Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 



der beiden Geschwindigkeitspfeile, so ist diese Verbindungsstrecke offen- 
bar die Zusatzgeschwindigkeit w^ die den ersten in den zweiten Ge- 
schwindigkeitszu stand überführt. Wir erhalten somit ein gleichschenk- 
liges Dreieck CED mit der Basis w und den Schenkeln v^ und wir 
erkennen sogleich, daß der Winkel a an der Spitze gleich dem Zentri- 
winkel des Bogens AB ist, den der bewegte Punkt durchläuft; denn die 
Geschwindigkeiten in A und B stehen auf den Radien MA und MB 
senkrecht, schließen also denselben Winkel ein. Folglich sind die beiden 
gleichschenkligen Dreiecke MAB und CDE einander ähnlich, und man 
erhält die Proportion

Nun ist DE = w ^ CD

radius r und AB gleich dem Bogen s bis auf einen kleinen Fehler, der 
durch hinreichend kleine Wahl des Zeitintervalls / beliebig herabgedrückt 
werden kann.

Wir dividieren nun durch t und beachten, daß — = z;, — = /^ ist; 
dann ergibt sich

d. h. die Zentripetalbeschleunigung ist gleich 
dem Quadrat der Umlaufgeschwindigkeit 
dividiert durch den Kreisradius. 

Aut diesem Satze beruht, wie wir 
sehen werden, einer der ersten und ge- 
wichtigsten Erfahrungsbeweise für die New- 
tonsche Theorie der Schwerkraft. 

Vielleicht ist es nicht überflüssig sich 
klar zu machen, wie die gleichförmige 
Kreisbewegung bei der graphischen Dar- 
stellung im a:,)' /-Räume als Kurve aus- 
sieht. Diese entsteht offenbar so, daß 
man den bewegten Punkt während der 
Kreisbewegung gleichmäßig parallel der /-Achse aufsteigen läßt; man er- 
hält eine Schraubenlinie^ die nun die Bahn und den zeitlichen Ablauf der 
Bewegung vollständig wiedergibt. In der Figur (Abb. i8) ist sie auf der 
Mantelfläche eines Zylinders gezeichnet, der die Kreisbahn der ^»r^-Ebene 
als Grundfläche hat.

5. Bewegung im Räume. 

Bei Bewegungen im Räume versagt unsere graphische Darstellung; 
denn hier haben wir 3 räumliche Koordinaten x, y^ 0, die Zeit / käme 
als vierte hinzu, leider ist aber unser An schauungs vermögen auf den drei- 
dimensionalen Raum beschränkt. Da muß nun die Formelsprache des 
Mathematikers helfend eingreifen; die Methoden der analytischen Geometrie 
erlauben nämlich, die Eigenschaften und Beziehungen räumlicher Gebilde 
rein rechnerisch zu behandeln, ohne daß man nötig hätte die Ans«:hau- 
ung zu Hilfe zu nehmen oder Figuren zu entwerfen. Ja, dieses Verfahren 
ist sogar viel mächtiger als die Konstruktion. Vor allem ist es nicht 
an die Dimensionenzahl 3 gebunden, sondern ohne weiteres auch in 
Räumen von 4 oder mehr Dimensionen anwendbar. In der Sprache der 
Mathematiker bedeutet der Begriff eines Raumes von mehr als 3 Dimen- 
sionen nichts Mystisches, sondern ist einfach ein kurzer Ausdruck dafür, 
daß man mit Dingen zu tun hat, die sich durch mehr als 3 Zahlen- 
angaben vollständig bestimmen lassen. So ist die Lage eines Punktes zu 
einer bestimmten Zeit eben nur durch 4 Zahlenangaben festzulegen, die 
3 räumlichen Koordinaten jc, j, z und die Zeit /. Wenn wir nun ge- 
lernt haben, mit dem xy /-Räume als Bild von ebenen Bewegungen um- 
zugehen, so wird es uns nicht schwer fallen, auch die Bewegungen im 
dreidimensionalen Räume unter dem Bilde von Kurven im ^j^s /-Räume 
anzusehen. Diese Auffassung der Kinematik als Geometrie in einem 
vierdimensionalen xyzt-'KsiXmiQ bringt den Vorteil mit sich, daß man die 
bekannten geometrischen Gesetze auf die Bewegungslehre übertragen kann. 
Sie hat aber noch eine tiefere Bedeutung, die in der Einsteinschen 
Theorie deutlich hervortreten wird. Es wird sich zeigen, daß die Be- 
griffe Raum und Zeit, die Erlebnisinhalte ganz verschiedener QuaHtät 
sind, als Objekte physikalischer Messungen gar nicht scharf geschieden 
werden können; die Physik wird, wenn sie an dem Grundsatze festhalten 
will, nur physikalisch Feststellbares als wirklich anzuerkennen, die Begriffe 
von Raum und Zeit zu einer höheren Einheit verschmelzen müssen, eben 
dem vierdimensionalen xyzt-RBMm. Minkowski hat (1908) diesen 
•>die Welt*- genannt, wodurch er zum Ausdrucke bringen wollte, daß das 
Element aller Ordnung der reellen Dinge nicht der Ort und nicht der 
Zeitpunkt, sondern -»das Ereignis <^ oder -»der Weltpunkt ^ ist, d. h. ein 
Ort zu einer bestimmten Zeit. Die Bildkurve eines bewegten Punktes 
nannte er -^Weltlinie^^ ein Ausdruck, den wir im folgenden immer ge- 
brauchen werden. Die geradlinig gleichförmige Bewegung entspricht also 
einer geraden Weltlinie, die beschleunigte Bewegung einer gekrümmten. 

6. Dynamik. Das Trägheitsgesetz. 

Nach diesen Vorbereitungen wenden wir uns nun der Frage zu, von 
der wir ausgingen, nämhch in welcher Weise Kräfte Bewegungen er- 
zeugen. 



24 I^i^ Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 

Der einfachste Fall ist der, daß überhaupt keine Kräfte da sind. Dann 
wird ein ruhender Körper sicherlich nicht in Bewegung gesetzt. Diese 
Feststellung naachten bereits die Alten; sie glaubten aber überdies, daß 
auch das Umgekehrte gelten müsse: wo Bewegung sei, müßten auch 
Kräfte wirken, die sie unterhalten. Diese Ansicht führt sogleich auf 
Schwierigkeiten, wenn man sich überlegt, warum ein geschleuderter Stein 
oder Speer weiter fliegt, wenn er die Hand verlassen hat; diese ist 
es offenbar, die ihn in Bewegung bringt, ihre Einwirkung aber ist zu 
Ende, sobald die Bewegung eigentlich begonnen hat. Die antiken Denker 
haben viel darüber gegrübelt, welche Kräfte es sind, die die Bewegung 
des fliegenden Steines aufrecht erhalten. Erst Galilei fand den richtigen 
Standpunkt der Sache gegenüber; er bemerkte, daß es ein Vorurteil sei, 
anzunehmen, wo Bewegung sei, müsse auch jederzeit Kraft sein. Man 
müsse vielmehr die Frage stellen, welche quantitative Eigenschaft der Be- 
wegung mit der Kraft in einem gesetzmäßigen Zusammenhange steht, 
etwa der Ort des bewegten Körpers, oder seine Geschwindigkeit oder 
seine Beschleunigung oder eine von diesen allen abhängige, kombinierte 
Größe. Darüber läßt sich durch bloßes Nachdenken nichts herausphiloso- 
phieren, sondern man muß die Natur befragen, und die Antwort, die 
diese zunächst gibt, lautet so, daß die Kräfte auf die Geschwindigkeits- 
änderungen Einfluß haben: Zur Aufrechterhaltung einer Bewegung, bei 
der Größe und Richtung der Geschwindigkeit unverändert bleiben, ist 
keine Kxaft erforderlich, und umgekehrt: Wo keine Kräfte sind, bleibt 
auch Größe und Richtung der Geschwindigkeit unverändert, also ein 
ruhender Körper in Ruhe, ein geradlinig und gleichförmig bewegter Körper 
in geradliniger und gleichförmiger Bewegung. 

Dieses Gesetz vom Beharrungsvermögen oder von der Trägheit liegt nun 
aber keineswegs so klar zu Tage, wie sein einfacher Wortlaut vermuten 
ließe. Denn Körper, die wirklich allen Einwirkungen entzogen sind, kennen 
wir in unserer Erfahrung nicht, und wenn wir sie uns in der Einbildungs- 
kraft vorstellen, wie sie einsam mit konstanter Geschwindigkeit auf gerader 
Bahn durch den Weltenraum ziehen, so geraten wir sofort in da3 Problem 
der absolut geraden Bahn im absolut ruhenden Räume, wovon wir erst 
später ausführlich zu reden haben werden. Wir verstehen daher vorläufig 
das Trägheitsgesetz in dem eingeschränkten Sinne, den es bei Galilei 
hatte. 

Wir denken uns einen glatten, genau horizontalen Tisch und darauf 
eine glatte Kugel; diese wird von ihrem Gewichte auf den Tisch ge- 
drückt, wir stellen aber fest, daß wir keine merkliche Kraft brauchen, um 
die Kugel auf dem Tische ganz langsam zu bewegen. Auf die Kugel wirkt 
offenbar in horizontaler Richtung keine Kraft, sonst würde sie ja nicht 
an jeder Stelle von selbst in Ruhe bleiben. 

Erteilen wir ihr nun aber eine Geschwindigkeit, so rollt sie auf gerader 
Linie fort und wird nur äußerst wenig verlangsamt. Diese Verlangsamung 
wurde von GaHlei als eine sekundäre Wirkung erkannt, die der Reibung 



Der Stoß oder Impuls. 25 



am Tisch und an der Luft zuzuschreiben ist, wenn auch die reibenden 
Kräfte nach den statischen Methoden, von denen wir ausgegangen sind, 
nicht nachweisbar sind. Der richtige Blick für die Unterscheidung des 
Wesentlichen an einem Vorgange von störenden Nebenwirkungen macht 
eben den großen Forscher aus. 

Auf dem Tische ist also jedenfalls das Trägheitsgesetz bestätigt; es 
ist festgestellt, daß bei fehlenden Kräften die Geschwindigkeit nach Rich- 
tung und Größe konstant bleit. 

Folglich werden die Kräfte mit der Geschwindigkeitsänderung, der 
Beschleunigung, verknüpft sein; wie, läßt sich wieder nur durch die Er- 
fahrung entscheiden. 

7. Der Stoß oder Impuls. 

Wir haben die Beschleunigung einer ungleichförmigen Bewegung als 
Grenzfall von plötzlichen Geschwindigkeitsänderungen kurzer gleichförmiger 
Bewegungen dargestellt. Wir werden daher zunächst fragen, wie eine 
einzelne plötzliche Geschwindigkeitsänderung durch den Angriff einer 
Kraft erzeugt wird. Dazu muß die Kraft nur einen kurzen AugenbHck 
wirksam sein; sie ist dann das, was man einen Stoß oder Impuls nennt. 
Der Erfolg eines solchen Stoßes hängt nicht nur von der Größe der 
Kraft, sondern auch von der Dauer der Einwirkung ab, auch wenn diese 
sehr kurz ist. Man definiert daher die Stärke eines Stoßes folgender- 
maßen : 

n Impulse y, deren jeder darin besteht, daß während der Zeit von 

/ = — sec die Kraft K wirkt, werden, wenn sie dicht hintereinander 
n 

ohne merkliche Pausen erfolgen, genau denselben Erfolg haben, als wenn 

die Kraft K die ganze Sekunde lang anhielte; also wird 

I 



sein; oder^ 



(5) J=.-K=tK. 



n 




Um das zu veranschaulichen, Abb. 19. 

denke man sich etwa auf die 

eine Seite eines gleicharmigen Hebels (Wagebalken) ein Gewicht gelegt, auf 
die andere aber mit einem Hammer gleich starke, schnelle Schläge aus- 
geführt, mit solcher Kraft und so rasch, daß der Hebel bis auf unmerk- 
liche Schwankungen im Gleichgewicht bleibt (Abb. 19). Dabei kann man 
offenbar schwächer und häufiger, oder langsamer und stärker schlagen, 
nur muß die Stoßstärke J multipliziert mit der Schlagzahl n^ oder 
dividiert durch die auf jeden Schlag entfallende Zeit t, immer gerade 
gleich dem Gewicht K sein. Mit dieser »Stoß wage« sind wir imstande, 



26 



Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 



die Stärke von Stößen zu messen, auch wenn wir die Zeitdauer und 
Kraft des einzelnen nicht feststellen können; wir brauchen nur die Kraft K 
zu bestimmen, die n gleichen Stößen in der Sekunde (bis auf unmerk- 
liche Erzitterungen der Stoßwage) das Gleichgewicht hält, dann ist die 
Größe des einzelnen Stoßes der «-te Teil von K. 

Die Dimension des Impulses ist [/] = \tG\ ihre Einheit im üblichen 
Maßsystem sec g. 

8. Der Impulssatz. 

Wir betrachten nun wieder die Kugel auf dem Tische und studieren 
die Wirkung von Stößen auf sie. Hierzu gebrauchen wir etwa einen um 
eine horizontale Achse drehbaren Hammer, den wir von bestimmter Höhe 
herabfallen lassen. Zunächst wird für jede Fallhöhe die Stoßstärke an 
unserer »Stoß wage« geeicht. Sodann lassen wir ihn gegen die auf 
dem Tisch ruhende Kugel schlagen und beobachten die Geschwindig- 
keit, die sie durch den Stoß bekommt, indem wir messen, wieviele cm 
sie in i sec rollt (Abb. 20). Das Resultat ist sehr einfach: 

Je stärker der Stoß, um 
so größer die Geschwindig- 
keit, und zwar entspricht 
dem doppelten Stoße die 
doppelte Geschwindigkeit, 
dem dreifachen Stoße die 
dreifache Geschwindigkeit 
usw. Geschwindigkeit und 
Stoß stehen in konstantem 
Verhältnis (sind propor- 
tional). 

Das ist das Grundgesetz 
der Dynamik, der soge- 
nannte Impulssatz^ für den 
einfachen Fall, daß ein 
Körper aus der Ruhe in Bewegung gesetzt wird. Hat die Kugel schon 
eine Geschwindigkeit, so wird der Stoß sie vergrößern oder verkleinern, 
je nachdem er die Kugel von hinten oder vorn trifft. Durch starken 
Gegenstoß kann man die Kugel zum plötzlichen Umkehren bringen. 

Das Impulsgesetz lautet dann so, daß die plötzlichen Geschwindigkeits- 
änderungen des Körpers sich verhalten wie die Stöße^ durch die sie erzeugt 
sind. Dabei werden die Geschwindigkeiten je nach ihrer Richtung als 
positiv oder negativ gerechnet. 

g. Die Masse. 

Bisher haben wir mit einer einzigen Kugel operiert; jetzt wollen wir 
denselben Stoßversuch ausführen mit Kugeln verschiedener Art, etwa von 
verschiedener Größe oder aus verschieden -m Material, die einen massiv. 




Abb. 20. 



Die Masse. .27 

die andern ausgehöhlt. Alle diese Kugeln mögen durch gleichstarke Stöße 
in Bewegung gesetzt werden. Der Versuch zeigt, daß sie dann ganz ver- 
schiedene Geschwindigkeiten bekommen, und zwar sieht man sogleich, 
daß leichte Kugeln weit geschleudert werden, schwere nur langsam fort- 
rollen. Wir finden hier also einen Zusammenhang mit dem Gewichte, 
auf den wir nachher ausführlich eingehen werden, denn er ist eine der 
empirischen Grundlagen der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie. Hier aber 
wollen wir gerade im Gegenteil uns klar machen: rein begrifflich hat die 
Tatsache, daß verschiedene Kugeln durch gleichstarke Stöße verschiedene 
Geschwindigkeiten erhalten, gar nichts mit Gewicht zu tun. Das Gewicht 
wirkt nach unten und erzeugt den Druck der Kugel auf den Tisch, aber 
keinerlei horizontale Kraft. Wir finden nun, daß eine Kugel sich dem 
Stoße mehr widersetzt als die andere\ wenn die erste zugleich die schwerere 
ist, so ist das eine neue empirische Tatsache, läßt sich aber von dem 
hier eingenommenen Standpunkte aus auf keine Weise etwa aus dem Be- 
griffe des Gewichts deduzieren. Was wir feststellen, ist ein verschiedener 
Widerstand der Kugeln gegen Stöße; man nennt ihn den Trägheitswider- 
stand und mißt ihn durch das Verhältnis des Stoßes J zu der erzeugten 
Geschwindigkeit v. Für dieses Verhältnis hat man den Namen Masse 
und den Buchstaben m gewählt ; man setzt also : 

(6) m^J-\ 

und diese Formel besagt, daß für denselben Körper eine Vergrößerung 
des Impulses / eine größere Geschwindigkeit hervorruft derart, daß ihr 
Verhältnis immer denselben Wert m hat. Nach dieser Definition der 
Masse ist ihre Einheit nicht mehr frei wählbar, weil die Einheiten der 
Geschwindigkeit und des Stoßes schon festgelegt sind; vielmehr hat die 
Masse die Dimension 



H = m 



und ihre Einheit ist im üblichen Maßsysteme sec'g/cm. 

Im gewöhnlichen Sprachgebrauche bedeutet das Wort Masse etwa 
dasselbe wie Substanzmenge, Quantität der Materie, ohne daß diese Be- 
griffe selbst scharf definiert sind; der Substanzbegriff wird als Kategorie 
des Verstandes zu den unmittelbaren Gegebenheiten gezählt. In der Physik 
aber, und das müssen wir auf das nachdrücklichste betonen, hat das 
Wort Masse keine andere Bedeutung als die durch die Formel (6) ge- 
gebene: sie ist das Maß des Widerstandes gegen Geschwindigkeitsände- 
rungen. 

Wir können den Impulssatz etwas allgemeiner so schreiben: 

(7) wze/ = /; 

er bestimmt die Geschwindigkeits^w^^n/«^ w^ die ein (in Bewegung be- 
findlicher) Körper durch den Stoß J erfährt. 



28 Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 

Man pflegt die Formel auch so zu interpretieren: 

Die gegebene Stoßkraft J des Hammers wird auf die bewegliche Kugel 
übertragen; der Hammer »verliert« den Impuls y, dieser kommt in der 
Bewegung der Kugel wieder im gleichen Betrage mw zum Vorschein. 
Diese Stoßkraft trägt die rollende Kugel mit sich, und wenn sie selbst 
gegen einen Körper prallt, so versetzt sie diesem wieder einen Stoß 
und verliert dadurch gerade ebensoviel Impuls, als der andere Körper 
gewinnt. Prallen z. B. zwei Kugeln von den Massen m^ und 7n^ gerad- 
linig aufeinander, so sind die Stoßkräfte, die sie aufeinander ausüben, 
stets entgegengesetzt gleich, ^^ = — J^i ihre Summe also gleich Null: 

(8) J^-{- J^z= rn^w^ + m^w^ == o; 

daruas folgt 



W r= . W 



ij 



d. h. wenn die eine Kugel Geschwindigkeit verliert [w^ negativ), gewinnt 
die andere (w^ positiv), und umgekehrt. 

Führt man die Geschwindigkeiten der beiden Kugeln vor und nach 
dem Stoße ein, nämlich v^^ v\ für die erste, v^^ v'^ für die zweite Kugel, 
so sind die Geschwindigkeitsänderungen 

w^ = v\ —v^, w^^v'^—v^, 

und man kann die Gleichung (8) so schreiben: 

^i {^'x — ^i) + ^2 (2^2 — z^J = o. 

Bringt man hier die auf die Bewegung vor dem Stoße bezüglichen 
Größen auf die eine Seite, die auf die Bewegung nach dem Stoße be- 
züglichen auf die andere, so erhält man 

(9) ^i^i + ^2^3 = ^i^i + ^3^2 j 

und diese Gleichung läßt sich so deuten: 

Um einen Körper von der Ruhe auf die Geschwindigkeit v zu bringen, 
braucht man den Impuls mv\ diesen führt er dann mit sich. Der ge- 
samte, von den beiden Kugeln vor dem Stoße mitgeführte Impuls ist 
also m^v^ -\- m^v^. Die Gleichung (9) sagt dann aus, daß dieser durch 
den Stoß nicht geändert wird. Das ist das Gesetz von der Erhaltung 
des Impulses. 

10. Kraft und Beschleunigung. 

Ehe wir den auffälligen Parallelismus von Masse und Gewicht weiter 
verfolgen, wollen wir die gewonnenen Gesetze auf den Fall dauernd 
wirkender Kräfte übertragen; allerdings läßt sich eine strenge Begründung 
der Sätze wieder nur mit den Methoden der Infinitesimalrechnung geben, 
doch können die folgenden Betrachtungen wenigstens eine ungefähre 
Vorstellung der Zusammenhänge vermitteln. 



Kraft und Beschleunigung. 



29 



Eine kontinuierlich wirkende Kraft erzeugt eine Bewegung mit kon- 
tinuierlich sich ändernder Geschwindigkeit. Wir denken uns nun die 
Kraft ersetzt durch eine rasche Aufeinanderfolge von Stößen; dann wird 
die Geschwindigkeit bei jedem Stoße eine kleine plötzliche Änderung er- 
leiden, es entsteht eine vielfach geknickte Weltlinie wie in Abb. 10, die 
sich an die wirkliche, gleichmäßig gekrümmte W^ltlinie eng anschließt und 
sie für die Rechnung ersetzen kann. Wenn nun n Stöße während i sec 

die Kraft K ersetzen, so hat jeder von ihnen nach (5) den Wert J=^ — K 

oder = tK^ wo / die auf einen Stoß entfallende kurze Zeit ist. Bei 

jedem Stoß tritt eine Geschwindigkeitsänderung w ein, die nach (7) durch 

w . . . 

mw = J = tK oder m — =K bestimmt ist. Nun ist aber nach (2) 

w 

— = ^, also erhält man 

(10) mb = K . 

Das ist das Bewegungsgesetz der Dynamik für kontinuierlich wirkende 
Kräfte; es lautet in Worten: 

Eine Kraft erzeugt eine zu ihr proportionale Beschleunigung] das kon- 
stante Verhältnis Klb ist die Masse. 

Man kann diesem Gesetze noch eine andere Form geben, die für 
viele Zwecke, insbesondere für die in der Einsteinschen Dynamik not- 
wendige Verallgemeinerung (s. VI, 7, S. 199) vorteilhaft ist. Ändert sich 
nämlich die Geschwindigkeit v um w, so ändert sich der vom bewegten 



Körper mitgeführte Impuls J z= mv um mw\ also ist mb 



mw 



die 



y 



Änderung des mitgeführten Impulses in der dazu gebrauchten kleinen 
Zeit /. Demnach kann man das in der 
Formel (10) ausgedrückte Grundgesetz 
auch so aussprechen: 

Wirkt auf einen Körper eine Kraft K^ 
so ändert sich sein mitgeführter Impuls 
J ■= mv derart^ daß seine Änderung pro 
Zeiteinheit gleich der Kraft K ist. 

In dieser Form gilt das Gesetz zu- 
nächst nur für Bewegungen, die in einer 
geraden Linie vor sich gehen und bei 
denen die Kraft in derselben Geraden 
wirkt. Ist das nicht der Fall, wirkt die 
Kraft seitlich zur momentanen Bewegungs- 
richtung, so muß das Gesetz etwas verallgemeinert werden; man denke 
sich die Kraft als einen Pfeil gezeichnet und diesen auf drei zueinander 
senkrechte Richtungen, etwa die Koordinatenachsen, projiziert. In der 
Abbildung (Abb. 21) ist der Fall dargestellt, daß die Kraft in der ^y- Ebene 




Abb. 21, 



lO I^is Grundgesetze der klassischen Meclianik. 

wirkt, und es sind ihre Projektionen auf die x- und die jj;- Achse ein- 
getragen. Ebenso denke man sich den bewegten Punkt auf die Achsen 
projiziert; jeder der Projektionspunkte vollführt dann auf seiner Achse 
eine Bewegung. Das Bewegungsgesetz lautet dann so, daß die Beschleu- 
nigungen dieser Projektionsbewegungen mit den entsprechenden Kraft- 
komponenten in der Beziehung md = K stehen. Wir wollen aber auf 
diese mathematischen Verallgemeinerungen, die begrifflich nichts Neues 
bieten, nicht genauer eingehen. 

II. Beispiel. Elastische Schwingungen. 

Als Beispiel der Beziehung zwischen Kraft, Masse, Beschleunigung 
betrachten wir einen Körper, der unter der Wirkung elastischer Kräfte 
Schwingungen ausführen kann. Wir nehmen etwa eine gerade, breite 
Stahlfeder und befestigen sie an einem Ende so, daß sie in der Ruhelage 
horizontal liegt (nicht nach unten hängt); am anderen Ende trage sie eine 
Kugel (Abb. 22). Dann kann diese in der Horizontalebene hin imd her 
schwingen; die Schwere hat keinen Einfluß auf ihre Bewegung, diese 

hängt nur von der elastischen Kraft 
^ y ^ ^^^ Feder ab. Bei kleinen Ausschlä- 

i Ij gen bewegt sich die Kugel fast gerad- 

^ •• ^ linig; ihre Bewegungsrichtung sei die 

:v-Achse. 

Setzt man die Kugel in Bewegung, 
so vollführt sie eine periodische Schwin- 
gung, deren Wesen man sich so klar 
macht: Man bringe die Kugel mit der 
^ Hand etwas aus der Gleichgewichtslage, 
" ^ dabei spürt man die zurückziehende Kraft 

Abb. 22. der Feder. Läßt man die Kugel los, so 

erteilt diese Kraft ihr eine Beschleuni- 
gung, sie kehrt mit wachsender Geschwindigkeit in die Mittellage zu- 
rück. Dabei nimmt aber die rückziehende Kraft, also auch die Be- 
schleunigung, dauernd ab und wird beim Passieren der Mittellage selbst 
gleich Null; denn in dieser ist die Kugel ja im Gleichgewichte, es greift 
also keine beschleunigende Kraft an ihr an. An derselben Stelle, wo 
die Geschwindigkeit am größten ist, ist also die Beschleunigung am 
kleinsten. Infolge des Beharrungsvermögens schießt die Kugel durch die 
Gleichgewichtslage hindurch, dabei tritt die Federkraft verzögernd auf und 
bremst die Bewegung ab. Wenn der ursprüngliche Ausschlag nach der 
anderen Seite erreicht ist, ist die Geschwindigkeit auf Null gesunken, die 
Kraft hat. ihren größten Wert erreicht; zugleich hat auch die Beschleuni- 
gung ihren größten Wert, indem sie in diesem Augenblick die Richtung 
der Geschwindigkeit umkehrt. Von da an wiederholt sich der Vorgang 
im umgekehrten Sinne. 




Beispiel. Elastische Schwingungen. 



31 



Wenn man nun die Kugel durch eine andere von verschiedener Masse 
ersetzt, so sieht man, daß der Charakter der Bewegung derselbe bleibt, 
aber die Dauer einer Schwingung verändert wird. Bei größerer Masse 
wird die Bewegung verlangsamt, die Beschleunigung wird kleiner; Ver- 
kleinerung der Masse erhöht die Schwingungszahl. 

In vielen Fällen kann man annehmen, daß die zurückziehende Kraft K 
dem Ausschlage x genau proportional ist. Dann kann man den Ablauf 
der Bewegung folgendermaßen geometrisch veranschaulichen. Man denke 
sich einen beweglichen Punkt P auf der Peripherie eines Kreises vom 
Radius a gleichförmig umlaufen, und zwar rmal in der Sekunde; er legt 

dann den Kreisumfang 2TCa [jc = 3,14 . . . .) in der Zeit T= — sec 

S 2 TT (Z 

zurück, also ist seine Geschwindigkeit — = — 2TCav. 

Nehmen wir nun den Kreismittelpunkt O zum Nullpunkt eines recht- 
winkligen Koordinatensystems, in dem F die Koordinaten x, y hat, so 
pendelt der Projektionspunkt A des 
Punktes P auf der :v:-Achse während 
des Umlaufs von P geradeso hin - 
und her, wie die an der Feder be- 
festigte Masse. Dieser Punkt A soll 
die schwingende Masse darstellen. 
Rückt P um ein kleines Bogen- 
stück s vor, so bewegt sich A auf 
der ::t:-Achse um ein kleines Stück ^, 

und es ist z; = — die Geschwindig- 
keit von A. Die Figur (Abb. 23) 
zeigt nun, daß die Verrückungen 
^ und s Kathete und Hypothe- 
nuse eines kleinen rechtwinkligen Dreiecks sind, das dem großen recht- 
winkhgen Dreieck OAP offenbar ähnlich ist; also gilt die Proportion 




Abb. 23. 



— = — oder

Daher wird die Geschwindigkeit von A 



t t a 

Nun vollführt der Projektionspunkt B des Punktes P auf der j-Achse 
genau eine ebensolche Pendelbewegung; bei der kleinen Verrückung s 
von P verschiebt sich B um ein Stück ly, und es gilt ganz ebenso wie 
für g

Dieser Änderung r] von y entspricht eine Änderung der Geschwindig-

Die Beschleunigung bei dieser Schwingungsbewegung des Punktes A 
ist also tatsächlich in jedem Augenblicke dem Ausschlage x proportional. 
Für die Kraft erhält man 

(ii) K =^ mh ■= m[2 7tvYx. 

Durch Messung der zu einem Ausschlage x gehörigen Kraft K und 

Zählung der Schwingungen kann man also die 
Masse m des Federpendels bestimmen. 

Das Bild der Weltlinie einer solchen 
Schwingung ist offenbar eine Wellenlinie in 
der ^v^-Ebene, wenn x die Schwingungsrich- 
tung ist (Abb. 24). In der Zeichnung ist an- 
genommen, daß die Kugel zur Zeit t = o 
die Mittellage x ■= o nach rechts passiert. 
Man sieht, daß immer beim Durchgang durch 
die /-Achse , d.h. für ^ = o , die Richtung 
der Kurve am flachsten gegen die :r-Achse 
ist, wodurch die größte Geschwindigkeit ge- 
kennzeichnet wird; dafür ist dort die Kurve 
ungekrümmt, die Geschwindigkeitsändernug 
oder Beschleunigung also Null. Umgekehrt 
verhält es sich an den Stellen, die den äußer- 
Abb. 24. sten Ausschlägen entsprechen. 




12. Gewicht und Masse. 

Wir haben sogleich bei der Einführung des Massenbegriffs festgestellt, 
daß Masse und Gewicht auffallend parallel gehen; schwere Körper wider- 
setzen sich beschleunigenden Kräften stärker als leichte. Handelt es sich 
nun hier um ein exaktes Gesetz? In der Tat ist das der Fall. Um 
den Sachverhalt ganz klar zu stellen, betrachten wir noch einmal den 
Versuch, bei dem Kugeln auf einem glatten, horizontalen Tische durch 
Stöße in Bewegung gesetzt werden. Wir nehmen zwei Kugeln A und B 
und es sei JB doppelt so schwer wie A^ d. h. ß hält auf der Wage zwei 
gleichen Exemplaren von A das Gleichgewicht. Jetzt versetzen wir A 
und B gleiche Stöße auf dem Tische und beobachten die erreichte 



Gewicht und Masse. 



33 



Geschwindigkeit; wir finden, daß A genau doppelt so schnell davonrollt 
wie B. 

Die doppelt so schwere Kugel B widersetzt sich also einer Geschwin- 
digkeitsänderung gerade doppelt so stark wie die Kugel A. Man kann 
das auch so ausdrücken: Körper mit doppelter Masse haben das doppelte 
Gewicht, oder allgemein: die Massen m verhalten sich wie die Gewichte G. 
Das Verhältnis von Gewicht und Masse ist eine ganz bestimmte Zahl; 
man bezeichnet es mit g und schreibt 



(12) 



7n 



g oder G = mg 



Natürlich ist das Experiment, das wir zur Erläuterung des Gesetzes heran- 
gezogen haben, äußerst roh''). Es gibt aber viele andere Erscheinungen, 
die dieselbe Tatsache beweisen, vor allem die, daß alle Körper gleich 
schnell fallen. Dabei ist natürlich vorauszusetzen, daß keine andern 
Kräfte als die Schwere auf die Bewegung Einfluß haben, man muß also 
den Versuch im luftleeren Räume machen, um den Luftwiderstand zu 
beseitigen. Zur Demonstration geeignet ist eine schiefe Ebene (Abb. 25), 
auf der man zwei äußerlich gleiche, aber verschieden schwere Kugeln 
herunterrollen läßt; man beobachtet, 
daß sie genau gleichzeitig unten an- 
kommen. 

Das Gewicht ist die treibende 
Kraft, die Masse bestimmt den Wider- 
stand; stehen beide im gleichen Ver- 
hältnisse, so wird ein schwerer Kör- 
per zwar stärker angetrieben als ein 
leichter, dafür wehrt er sich aber 
gegen den Antrieb stärker, und das 
Resultat ist, daß der schwere und 

der leichte Körper gleich schnell herabrollen bzw. fallen. Man erkennt 
das auch aus unseren Formeln; denn wenn man in (10) für die Kraft das 
Gewicht G setzt und dieses nach (12) der Masse proportional annimmt, 
so erhält man: 




Abb. 25. 



mb = G 



mg 



also 
(13) 



b=g. 



Alle Körper haben also ein und dieselbe Beschleunigung vertikal abwärts, 
wenn sie sich allein unter dem Einfluß der Schwere bewegen, sie mögen 



^) So wird z. B. der Umstand vernachlässigt, daß auch bei der Erzeugung der 
Rotation der rollenden Kugel ein Widerstand überwunden werden muß, der von der 
Massenverteilung im Innern der Kugel (Trägheitsmoment) abhängt.

frei herabfallen oder geworfen sein. Die Größe g^ die Schwerebeschleu- 
nigung, hat den Wert ^=981 cm/sec^. 

Die schärfsten Versuche zur Prüfung dieses Gesetzes gelingen mit 
Hilfe von Fadenpendeln; bereits Newton hat bemerkt, daß die Schwin- 
gungsdauern bei derselben Fadenlänge / immer gleich sind, was auch für 
eine Kugel den Pendelkörper bilde. Der Vorgang der Schwingung ist 
ganz derselbe, den wir oben bei dem elastischen Pendel beschrieben 
haben, nur zieht nicht eine Stahlfeder, sondern die Schwere die Pendel- 
kugel zurück. Die Schwerkraft muß man in zwei Komponenten zerlegt 
denken; die eine wirkt in der Verlängerung des Fadens und spannt 
diesen, die andere wirkt in der Bewegungsrichtung und ist die treibende 
Kraft der Pendelkugel. 

Die Abb. 26 zeigt die Pendelkugel im Ausschlage x\ man erkennt 
zwei ähnliche, rechtwinklige Dreiecke, deren Seiten also das gleiche Ver- 
hältnis haben: 

K — ^

Demnach liefert die Formel (11) für die beiden Pendel 




/ \2 ^I 

also 



[zTt'vYm^ = 



Abb. 26. 



^ = — = [2 7TV) /, 

d. h. das Verhältnis von Gewicht und 
Masse ist für beide Pendel dasselbe. 
Wir hatten dieses Verhältnis oben in 
Formel (12)^ genannt; wir bekommen 
also die Gleichung 

(14) g=(27tvYlj 

woraus man sieht, daß sich g durch 
Messung der Pendellänge / und der 
Schwingungszahl v bestimmen läßt. 
Häufig spricht man das Gesetz von der Proportionalität des Gewichts 
mit der Masse so aus: 

schwere und träge Masse sind gleich. 
Dabei versteht man unter schwerer Masse einfach das durch g dividierte 
Gewicht und fügt dann bei der eigentlichen Masse zum Unterschiede 
das Beiwort »träge« hinzu. 

Daß dieses Gesetz sehr genau gilt, hat bereits Newton gewußt; heute 
ist es durch die allerschärfsten Messungen, die die Physik kennt und die 
von Eötvös (1890) ausgeführt wurden, aufs genaueste bestätigt worden. 
Man ist also vollständig berechtigt, die Wägung nicht nur zur Verglei- 
chung der Gewichte, sondern auch der Massen zu benutzen. 



Die analytische Mechanik. 35 



Man müßte nun denken^ daß ein solches Gesetz in den Fundamenten 
der Mechanilc fest verankert sei. Doch ist das keineswegs der Fall, wie 
unsere Darstellung zeigt^ die den Gedankeninhalt der klassischen Mechanik 
ziemlich getreu wiedergibt. Vielmehr klebt es, als eine Art Kuriosum, 
locker an dem Gefüge der übrigen Sätze. Viele haben sich wohl über 
die Tatsache gewundert, niemand aber suchte dahinter einen tieferen Zu- 
sammenhang. Es gibt doch vielerlei Kräfte, die an einer Masse angreifen 
können; warum soll es nicht eine geben, die der Masse genau propor- 
tional ist? Eine Frage, auf die keine Antwort erwartet wird, wird auch 
nicht beantwortet. Und so blieb die Sache unberührt, jahrhundertelang. 
Das war nur dadurch möglich, daß die Erfolge der Galilei-Newtonschen 
Mechanik überwältigend waren; sie beherrschte nicht nur die irdischen 
Bewegungs Vorgänge , sondern auch die der Gestirne und erwies sich als 
zuverlässiges Fundament der gesamten exakten Naturwissenschaft. Galt 
doch besonders in der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts als Ziel der Forschung, 
alle physikalischen Vorgänge als mechanische im Sinne der Newtonschen 
Lehre zu deuten. So wurde beim Bau des Hauses vergessen, ob die 
Fundamente stark genug wären, das Ganze zu tragen. Erst Einstein er- 
kannte die Wichtigkeit des Satzes von der Gleichheit der trägen und 
schweren Masse für die Grundlagen der physikalischen Wissenschaften. 

13. Die analytische Mechanik. 

Die Aufgabe der rechnenden oder analytischen Mechanik ist es, aus 
dem Bewegungsgesetze 

mb = K 

die Bewegung zu finden, wenn die Kräfte K gegeben sind. Die Formel 
selber liefert nur die Beschleunigung, d. h. die Geschwindigkeitsänderung; 
daraus die Geschwindigkeit und aus dieser wieder den veränderlichen 
Ort des bewegten Punktes zu finden, ist eine Aufgabe der Integral- 
rechnung, die recht schwierig sein kann, wenn die Kraft in verwickelter 
Weise sich örtlich und zeitlich ändert. Einen Begriff von der Natur der 
Aufgabe gibt unsere Ableitung der Ortsveränderung bei einer gleichförmig 
beschleunigten Bewegung in einer geraden Linie (S. 17). Verwickelter 
ist schon die Bewegung in einer Ebene unter der Wirkung einer kon- 
stanten Kraft von bestimmter Richtung, wie bei einer Wurf- oder Fall- 
bewegung. Auch hier können wir den stetigen Ablauf näherungsweise 
ersetzen durch eine Folge von gleichförmigen Bewegungen, die durch 
Stöße ineinander übergeführt werden. Wir denken wieder an unsern 
Tisch und setzen fest, daß die darauf rollende Kugel jedesmal nach 
derselben kurzen Zeit t einen Stoß von derselben Größe und Richtung 
bekommen soll (Abb. 27). Wenn die Kugel nun mit beliebiger Anfangs- 
geschwindigkeit vom Punkte o ausläuft, so gelangt sie nach t sec zu 
einem Punkte i, wo sie der erste Stoß trifft; von dort läuft sie in einer 
andern Richtung mit einer andern Geschwindigkeit t sec weiter, bis sie im 

3* 



36 



Die Grandsfesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 



Punkte 2 wieder ein Stoß trifft, der sie ablenkt, usw. Jede einzelne Ablen- 
kung ist durch den Impulssatz bestimmbar; daher kann man den ganzen 
Bewegungs Vorgang konstruieren, und man sieht, daß durch den Ausgangs- 
punkt, die Anfangsrichtung und -geschwindigkeit der weitere Verlauf völlig 
bestimmt ist. Man hat in dieser ruckweisen Bewegung ein rohes Bild 
der Bewegung einer Kugel auf einer schiefen Ebene; dabei stimmt das 
Bild um so besser mit dem in Wirklichkeit kontinuierlichen Vorgange 

überein, je kleiner das 
Zeitintervall zwischen 
den Stößen gewählt 
wird. 

Was hier durch Kon- 
struktion erzielt wird, 
leistet im Falle kon- 
tinuierlich wirkender 
Kräfte die Integralrech- 
nung. Auch dann blei- 
ben der Ausgangspunkt 
und die Anfangsge- 
schwindigkeit nach 
Größe und Richtung 
völlig willkürlich; sind diese aber gegeben, so ist der weitere Verlauf der 
Bewegung vollkommen bestimmt. Ein und dasselbe Kraftgesetz kann also 
unendlich viele Bewegungen erzeugen^ je nach der Wahl der Anfangs- 
bedingungen; so beruht die ungeheure Menge der Fall- und Wurfbewe- 
gungen auf demselben Kraftgesetze, der vertikal nach unten wirkenden 
Schwere. 

Gewöhnlich handelt es sich bei den mechanischen Problemen nicht 
um die Bewegung eines Körpers, sondern um die mehrerer, die auf ein- 
ander Kräfte ausüben; dann sind die Kräfte selber gar nicht gegeben, 
sondern hängen selbst wieder von der unbekannten Bewegung ab. Man 
begreift, daß das Problem der rechnerischen Bestimmung der Bewegungen 
mehrerer Körper höchst verwickelt wird.

14. Der Energiesatz. 

Es gibt aber einen Satz, der eine große Erleichterung und Übersicht 
liefert und der auch für die weitere Entwicklung der physikalischen Wissen- 
schaften von größter Wichtigkeit geworden ist. Das ist der Satz von der Er- 
haltung der Energie. Wir können ihn natürlich hier nicht allgemein aus- 
sprechen oder gar beweisen; wir wollen nur seinen Inhalt an einfachen 
Beispielen kennen lernen. 

Ein Pendel, das man bei einer bestimmten Höhe der Kugel freigibt, 
steigt jenseits der Mittellage wieder zur selben Höhe auf — bis auf einen 
kleinen Fehler, der durch Reibung und Luftwiderstand verursacht wird 



Der Energiesatz. 



37 



(Abb. 28). Ersetzt man die Kreisbahn durch irgendeine andere, indem 
man die Kugel auf Schienen, wie auf einer Rutschbahn, rollen läßt (Abb. 29), 
so gilt genau dasselbe: die Kugel steigt immer wieder zur selben Höhe 
auf, von der sie ausgegangen ist. 

Daraus folgt nun leicht, daß die Geschwindigkeit, die die Kugel in 
irgendeinem Punkte P ihrer Bahn hat, nur von der Tiefe dieses Punktes 
P unter dem Ausgangspunkte A abhängt. Um das einzusehen, denke 





Abb. 28. 



Abb. 29. 



A 



man sich das Stück AP der Bahn verändert, den Rest PB aber bei- 
behalten. Würde die Kugel nun auf der einen Bahn von A nach P mit 
einer andern Anfangsgeschwindigkeit in P ankommen, als auf der andern, 
so würde sie beim Weiterrollen von P nach B nicht beide Male gerade 
B als Ziel erreichen; denn dazu ist offenbar eine eindeutig bestimmte 
Anfangsgeschwindigkeit in P erforderlich. Folglich hängt die Geschwindig- 
keit in P nicht von der Form des durchlaufenen Bahnstückes ab, und da 
P ein behebiger Punkt ist, so gilt das allgemein. Es muß 
also die Geschwindigkeit v bestimmt sein durch die Fallhöhe h 
allein. Die Richtigkeit des Satzes hängt davon ab, daß die 
Bahn (Schiene) als solche der Bewegung keinen Widerstand 
entgegensetzt, keine Kraft in der Bewegungsrichtung auf die 
Kugel ausübt, sondern nur den senkrechten Druck der Kugel 
auffängt. Fehlt die Schiene, so hat man den freien Fall oder 
Wurf, und es gilt dasselbe : die Geschwindigkeit an jeder Stelle 
hängt nur von der Fallhöhe ab. 

Diese Tatsache läßt sich nicht nur experimentell feststellen, 
sondern auch aus unsern Bewegungsgesetzen ableiten; dabei 
erhält man überdies die Form des Gesetzes, das die Abhängis:- 
keit der Geschwindigkeit von der Fallhöhe regelt. Wir be- 
haupten, daß es so lautet: 

Es sei X der von unten nach oben positiv gerechnete Fallweg (Abb. 30), 
V die Geschwindigkeit, m die Masse, G das Gewicht des Körpers; dann 
hat die Größe 





Abb. 30. 



(15) 



m 



E = —v^-\- Gx 



während des ganzen Fallvorganges denselben Wert. 



38 



Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 



Um das zu beweisen, denken wir uns unter E zunächst eine beliebige 
Größe, die von der Bewegung abhängt und sich dabei von Augenblick zu 
Ausrenblick ändert. In einem kleinen Zeitabschnitt / ändere sich E um e ; dann 



werden wir das Verhältnis 



als Änderungsgeschwindigkeit von E be- 



zeichnen, und zwar ist dabei die Meinung (genau wie früher bei der 
Definition der Bahngeschwindigkeit v und der Beschleunigung b)^ daß das 
Zeitintervall t immer kleiner und kleiner genommen werden soll. Wenn 
die Größe E sich, zeitlich nicht ändert, ist natürlich ihre Änderungs- 
geschwindigkeit Null, und umgekehrt. Wir bilden nun die Änderung obigen 
Ausdruckes E in der Zeit t\ während dieser nimmt die Fallhöhe x ab 
um z//, die Geschwindigkeit v zu um w = bt. Daher wird E nach Ab- 
lauf der Zeit / den Wert 

tu 

E' = —[v-\-wY-\-G[x — vt) 
haben. Nun ist aber 

was besagt, daß das Quadrat, errichtet über den aneinandergelegten 
Strecken v und w^ zerlegt werden kann in ein Quadrat mit der Seite v^ 
eines mit der Seite w und 2 gleiche Rechtecke mit den Seiten v und w 
(Abb. 31). Daher wird 



E' = 



m 



w 



V.W.

Zieht man hiervon den alten Wert von 
E ab, so bleibt als Änderung

e = E' — E = — w^ + mvw — Gvt 
2 

oder, da 2£^ = ^/ ist: 

771 

e == — b^t"^ -\- 77ivbt — Gvt . 
2 

Daher wird die Änderungsgeschwindigkeit 



w 



b'^t -\- Tnvb — Gv . 



Abb. 31. 



e 771 

T ~ 2 

Hier kann das GHed mit t weggelassen 
werden, weil es durch Verkleinerung des Zeitintervalles beliebig klein ge- 
macht werden kann. Man erhält also schHeßlich für die Änderungs- 
geschwindigkeit von E\ 

— = v[7nb — G] . 

Dieser Ausdruck hat aber auf Grund der Gesetze der Mechanik den 
Wert Null, denn nach (13) ist7nb = 77t g = G. Damit ist bewiesen, daß 



Der Energiesatz. 7 g 



die Größe ^ (15) zeitlich unverändert bleibt. Gibt man den Ausgangs- 
punkt und die Anfangsgeschwindigkeit der Bewegung, d. h. die Werte 
von X und v i\Xx t = 0^ so bekommt der Ausdruck E nach (15) einen 
bestimmten Wert; diesen behält er dann während der Bewegung bei. 

Daraus folgt, daß, wenn der Körper steigt, d. h. wenn x zunimmt, v 
abnehmen muß, und umgekehrt. Jedes der beiden Glieder des Ausdrucks 
E kann ja nur auf Kosten des andern wachsen. Das erste ist charak- 
teristisch für den Geschwindigkeitszustand des Körpers, das zweite für 
die Höhe, die er gegen die Schwerkraft erstiegen hat. Man hat für sie 
besondere Namen: 

tu 
T = — v^ heißt lebendige Kraft oder kinetische Energie^ 
2 

U =z Gx heißt Arbeitsfähigkeit oder potentielle Energie. 

Ihre Summe 

(16) 7-\-U=E 

heißt schlechtweg die mechanische Energie des Körpers, und der Satz, 
daß sie bei der Bewegung des Körpers unveränderlich ist, heißt der Satz 
von der Erhaltung der Energie. 

Die Dimension jeder Energiegröße ist \E\ = [Gl], ihre Einheit gem. 

Der Name Arbeitsfähigkeit stammt natürlich von der Arbeitsleistung 
des menschlichen Körpers bei der Hebung eines Gewichtes her. Nach 
dem Energiesatze verwandelt sich diese Arbeit beim Herabfallen in kine- 
tische Energie. Gibt man umgekehrt einem Körper kinetische Energie, 
indem man ihn in die Höhe wirft, so verwandelt sich diese dabei in 
potentielle Energie oder Arbeitsfähigkeit. 

Genau dasselbe, was wir hier für die Fallbewegung ausgeführt haben, 
gilt nun im weitesten Umfange für Systeme beliebig vieler Körper, solange 
zwei Voraussetzungen erfüllt sind: 

1. Es dürfen keine äußeren Eingriffe vorkommen, das System muß in 
sich abgeschlossen sein; 

2. es dürfen keine Vorgänge auftreten, bei denen mechanische Energie 
in Wärme, elektrische Spannkraft, chemische Affinität oder dgl. 
verwandelt wird. 

Immer gilt dann der Satz, daß 

E== r-h U 

konstant ist, wobei die kinetische Energie von den Geschwindigkeiten, 
die potentielle von den Lagen der bewegten Körper abhängt. 

In der Mechanik der Gestirne ist dieser ideale Fall mit größter Rein- 
heit verwirklicht; hier gilt die ideale Dynamik, deren Prinzipien wir ent- 
wickelt haben. 

In der irdischen Welt aber ist das keineswegs der Fall; jede Be- 
wegung unterliegt der Reibung, wodurch ihre Energie in Wärme ver- 



AQ Die Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 

wandelt wird. Die Maschinen, mit denen wir Bewegung erzeugen, setzen 
thermische, chemische, elektrische, magnetische Kräfte in mechanische 
um. Der Energiesatz in der engen, mechanischen Form kann dann nicht 
bestehen. Aber er läßt sich in erweiterter Form immer aufrecht erhalten; 
nennt man Q die Wärmeenergie, C die chemische, W die elektro- 
magnetische Energie usw., so gilt der Satz, daß für abgeschlossene Systeme 
immer die Summe 

(i?) £= T-\- U-^ Qj^C-\-W... 

konstant ist. 

Es würde uns zu weit führen, die Entdeckung und Begründung dieser 
Tatsache durch Robert Mayer, Joule (1842) und Helmholtz (1847) 
zu verfolgen oder zu untersuchen, wie die nichtmechanischen Energie- 
formen quantitativ bestimmt werden. Wir werden aber den EnergiebegrifF 
später brauchen, wenn wir von dem tiefen Zusammenhange sprechen, den 
die Relativitätstheorie zwischen Masse und Energie aufgedeckt hat. 

15. Dynamische Einheiten von Kraft und Masse. 

Das Verfahren, mit dem wir die Grundgesetze der Mechanik abge- 
leitet haben, beschränkt ihre Gültigkeit gewissermaßen auf unsere Tisch- 
fläche und ihre nächste Umgebung. Denn aus Erfahrungen auf kleinstem 
Räume, aus Laboratoriumsversuchen, haben wir unsere Begriffe und Sätze 
abstrahiert. Der Vorteil dabei ist, daß wir uns über die den Raum und 
die Zeit betrefifenden Voraussetzungen nicht den Kopf zu zerbrechen 
brauchten; die geradlinigen Bewegungen, von denen das Trägheitsgesetz 
handelt, können auf dem Tische mit dem Lineal nachgezogen werden, 
Apparate und Uhren sollen zur Messung der Bahnen und der Bewegungen 
zur Verfügung stehen. 

Jetzt wird es sich darum handeln, aus den engen Zimmern heraus- 
zutreten in den Weltenraum. Der erste Schritt dazu ist eine »Reise um 
die Welt«, worunter ja der Sprachgebrauch die kleine Erdkugel versteht. 
Wir werden die Frage stellen: Gelten denn alle die aufgestellten Sätze 
der Mechanik ebenso in einem Laboratorium in Buenos Aires oder in 
Kapstadt, wie sie hier gelten? 

Nun, das ist der Fall, bis auf eine Ausnahme, nämlich die Größe 
der Schwerebeschleunigung g. Wir haben gesehen, daß man diese durch 
Pendelbeobachtungen sehr genau messen kann. Es hat sich nun gezeigt, 
daß ein und dasselbe Pendel am Äquator etwas langsamer schwingt als 
in nördlicheren oder südlicheren Gegenden, es fallen weniger Schwin- 
gungen auf die Dauer eines Tages, d. h. einer Erdumdrehung; daraus folgt, 
daß g am Äquator einen kleinsten Wert hat und nach Norden und Süden 
zunimmt. Diese Zunahme ist ganz gleichmäßig bis zu den Polen, wo g 
seinen größten Wert hat. Worauf das beruht, werden wir später sehen; 
hier genügt die Feststellung der Tatsache. Diese hat nun aber für das 



Dynamische Einheiten von Kraft und Masse. 4I 

Maßsystem, mit dem wir bisher Kräfte und Massen gemessen haben, 
höchst unbequeme Folgen. 

Solange man nur Gewichte mit der Hebelwage miteinander vergleicht, 
ergeben sich keine Schwierigkeiten. Man denke sich aber eine Feder- 
wage hier im Laboratorium mit Gewichten geeicht; bringt man dann 
diese Federwage in südlichere oder nördlichere Breiten, so wird man finden, 
daß sie, mit denselben Gewichtsstücken belastet, andere Ausschläge gibt. 
Identifiziert man daher, wie wir es bisher getan haben. Gewicht mit 
Kraft, so bleibt einem nichts übrig, als .zu behaupten: die Federkraft 
habe sich geändert, sie hänge von der geographischen Breite ab. Das 
ist doch offenbar nicht der Fall: geändert hat sich nicht die Federkraft, 
sondern die Schwerkraft; es ist also verfehlt, das Gewicht ein und des- 
selben Metallstückes an allen Orten der Erde als Krafteinheit zu nehmen. 
Man kann nun das Gewicht eines bestimmten Körpers an einem be- 
stimmten Orte der Erde als Krafteinheit wählen; dieses läßt sich dann, 
wenn die Schwerebeschleunigung g durch Pendelmessungen bekannt ist, 
auf andere Orte übertragen. So geht tatsächlich die Technik vor; ihr 
Kraftmaß ist das Gewicht eines bestimmten Normalkörpers in Paris, das 
Gramm. Wir haben dieses bisher immer benutzt^ ohne seine Veränder- 
lichkeit mit dem Orte zu berücksichtigen; bei genauen Messungen muß 
aber die Reduktion auf den Normalort (Paris) angebracht werden. 

Die Wissenschaft hat dieses Maßsystem, bei dem ein irdischer Ort 
bevorzugt ist, verlassen und ein weniger willkürliches angenommen. 

Dazu bietet das Grundgesetz der Mechanik selbst eine geeignete Me- 
thode. Anstatt die Masse auf die Kraft zurückzuführen, bestimmt man 
die Masse als Grundgröße von der unabhängigen Dimension [m] und 
wählt ihre Einheit willkürlich: ein bestimmtes Stück Metall habe die 
Masse i. Tatsächlich nimmt man dazu dasselbe Metallstück, das der 
Technik als Gewichtseinheit dient, das Pariser Gramm, und diese Massen- 
einheit wird auch Gramm (g) genannt. Die doppelte Bedeutung dieses 
Wortes als Gewichtseinheit in der Technik und als Masseneinheit in der 
Physik kann leicht zu Irrtümern Anlaß geben. Wir gebrauchen im fol- 
genden das physikalische Maßsystem ^ dessen Grundeinheiten sind: für 
die Länge das cm, für die Zeit die sec, für die Masse das g. 

Die Kraft hat jetzt die abgeleitete Dimension 



[^]=[.^]=[-/] 



und die Einheit gcm/sec^, die auch i dyn genannt wird. 

Das Gewicht ist definiert durch G = mg^ die Masseneinheit hat also das 
Gewicht G = g dyn ; es ist mit der geographischen Breite veränderlich 
und hat in unseren Breiten den Wert ^=981 dyn. Dies ist die tech- 
nische Krafteinheit. Die Kraft einer Federwage ist, in dyn ausgedrückt, 
natürlich konstant, denn ihr Vermögen, eine bestimmte Masse zu be- 
schleunigen, ist von der geographischen Breite unabhängig. 



42 I^ie Grundgesetze der klassischen Mechanik. 

Die Dimension des Impulses ist jetzt 

seine Einheit g cm/sec. Endlich ist die Dimension der Energie 

ihre Einheit gcmYsec^ oder dyn cm. 

Nachdem wir nun das Maßsystem von allen irdischen Schlacken be- 
freit haben, können wir uns der Mechanik der Gestirne zuwenden. 



III. Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 

I. Der absolute Raum und die absolute Zeit. 

Die Prinzipien der Mechanik, wie wir sie hier entwickelt haben, fand 
Newton teils in Galileis Arbeiten vor, teils hat er sie selbst geschaffen. 
Ihm verdanken wir vor allem die bestimmte Formulierung der Definitionen 
und Sätze in solcher Allgemeinheit, daß sie von dem irdischen Experimente 
losgelöst erscheinen und sich auf die Vorgänge im Weltenraume über- 
tragen lassen. 

Newton mußte hierzu vor allem den eigentlich mechanischen Prinzipien 
bestimmte Behauptungen über den Raum und die Zeit voranschicken. 
Ohne solche Bestimmungen hat schon der einfachste Satz der Mechanik, 
das Trägheitsgesetz, keinen Sinn. Danach soll ein Körper, auf den keine 
Kräfte wirken, sich in gerader Linie gleichförmig bewegen. Denken wir 
an unsern Tisch, auf dem wir zuerst mit der rollenden Kugel experimentiert 
haben. Wenn nun die Kugel auf dem Tische in gerader Linie dahinroUt, 
so wird ein Beobachter, der ihre Bahn von einem andern Planeten aus 
messend verfolgte, behaupten müssen, daß die Bahn relativ zu seinem 
Standpunkte nicht genau geradlinig sei. Denn die Erde selbst rotiert und 
es ist klar, daß eine Bewegung, die dem mitbewegten Beobachter gerad- 
linig erscheint, weil sie auf seinem Tische eine gerade Spur hinterläßt, 
einem andern Beobachter, der die Drehung der Erde nicht mitmacht, ge- 
krümmt erscheinen muß. Man kann das in grober Weise so demon- 
strieren. 

Eine kreisförmige Scheibe aus weißem Karton wird auf einer Achse 
montiert, so daß man sie mit einer Kurbel drehen kann; vor der Scheibe 
wird ein Lineal AB angebracht. Nun drehe man die Scheibe möglichst 
gleichmäßig und fahre gleichzeitig mit einem Bleistifte an dem Lineal mit 
konstanter Geschwindigkeit entlang, so daß die Bleistiftspitze ihren Weg 
auf der Scheibe markiert. Dieser Weg wird nun natürlich keineswegs eine 
gerade Linie auf der Scheibe, sondern eine krumme Bahn, die bei größeren 
Drehgeschwindigkeiten sogar die Form einer Schlinge annehmen kann. 
Dieselbe Bewegung also, die ein mit dem Lineal fest verbundener Beob- 
achter als geradlinig und gleichförmig bezeichnet, wird ein mit der Scheibe 
mitbewegter Beobachter als krummlinig (und ungleichförmig) bezeichnen. 
Man kann diese Bewegung punktweise konstruieren, wie die leicht ver- 
ständliche Zeichnung (Abb. 32) anschaulich macht. 

Dieses Beispiel zeigt deutlich, daß das Trägheitsgesetz überhaupt nur 



44 



Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 



einen bestimmten Sinn hat, wenn der Raum, oder besser das Bezugsystem, 
in dem die Geradlinigkeit gelten soll, genau fixiert wird. 

Dem Kopernikanischen Weltbilde entspricht es nun natürlich, nicht die 
Erde als das Bezugsystem anzusehen, für das das Trägheitsgesetz gilt, 
sondern ein im Weltenraume irgendwie verankertes. Bei irdischen Experi- 
menten, z. B. bei der rollenden Kugel auf dem Tische, ist dann die Bahn 
des frei bewegten Körpers in Wirklichkeit gar nicht gerade, sondern ein 
wenig gekrümmt; daß das der primitiven Beobachtung entgehen muß, liegt 
nur an der Kürze der bei den Experimenten gebrauchten Wegstrecken 
gegenüber den Dimensionen der Erdkugel. Hier trägt, wie sehr oft in 
der Wissenschaft, die Ungenauigkeit der Beobachtung zur Entdeckung 
eines großen Zusammenhanges bei; hätte Galilei bereits so feine Beob- 
achtungen machen können, wie spätere Jahrhunderte, so hätte die Ver- 





RelaJ-ive Bahn 



Abb. 32. 



worrenheit der Erscheinungen die Auffindung der Gesetze wesentlich er- 
schwert. Vielleicht hätte auch Kepler die Planetenbewegungen nie 
entwirrt, wenn zu seiner Zeit die Bahnen mit der heute erreichten Ge- 
nauigkeit bekannt gewesen wären; denn die ElHpsen Keplers sind nur 
Annäherungen, von denen sich die wirklichen Bahnen in längeren Zeiten 
wesentlich entfernen. In der heutigen Physik lag es z. B. bei den Ge- 
setzmäßigkeiten der Spektren ähnlich; die Auffindung einfacher Beziehungen 
wurde durch die Fülle des genauesten Beobachtungsmaterials sehr erschwert 
und verzögert. 

Newton wurde also vor die Aufgabe gestellt, das Bezugsystem zu 
suchen, in dem das Trägheitsgesetz und weiterhin die übrigen Grundsätze 
der Mechanik gelten sollten. Hätte er die Sonne gewählt, so wäre die 
Frage nicht gelöst, sondern nur verschoben worden; denn eines Tages 
konnte ja auch die Sonne als bewegt erkannt werden, wie es heute tat- 
sächlich der Fall ist. 

Aus solchen Gründen kam wohl Newton zu der Überzeugung, daß ein 
empirisches, durch materielle Körper festgelegtes Bezugsystem überhaupt 
niemals die Grundlage eines Satzes von dem Gedankeninhalte des Träg- 
heitsgesetzes sein könnte. Das Gesetz selber aber erscheint durch seine 



Der absolute Raum und die absolute Zeit. 45 

enge Beziehung zu der Raumlehre Euklids, deren Element die gerade 
Linie ist, als der natürliche Ausgangspunkt der Dynamik des Weltraums. 
Eben durch das Trägheitsgesetz offenbart sich der Euklidische Raum 
außerhalb der engen, irdischen Welt. Ähnlich liegt es mit der Zeit, deren 
Ablauf in der gleichförmigen Trägheitsbewegung zum Ausdruck kommt. 
So mag Newton zu der Ansicht gelangt sein, daß es einen absoluten 
Raum und eine absolute Zeit gibt. Wir zitieren am besten seine eigenen 
Worte; über die Zeit sagt er: 

»I. Die absolute^ wahre und mathematische Zeit verfließt an sich und 
vermöge ihrer Natur gleichförmig und ohne Beziehung auf irgend einen 
äußeren Gegenstand. Sie wird auch mit dem Namen Dauer belegt«. 

»Die relative, scheinbare und gewöhnliche Zeit ist ein fühlbares und 
äußerliches, entweder genaues oder ungleiches -Maß der Dauer, dessen 
man sich gewöhnlich statt der wahren Zeit bedient, wie Stunde, Tag, 
Monat, Jahr«. 

» Die natürlichen Tage, welche gewöhnlich als Zeitmaß für gleich 

gehalten werden, sind nämlich eigentlich ungleich. Diese Ungleichheit 
verbessern die Astronomen, indem sie die Bewegung der Himmelskörper 
nach der richtigen Zeit messen. Es ist möglich, daß keine gleichförmige 
Bewegung existiere, durch welche die Zeit genau gemessen werden kann, 
alle Bewegungen können beschleunigt oder verzögert werden; allein der 
Verlauf der absoluten Zeit kann nicht geändert werden. Dieselbe Dauer 
und dasselbe Verharren findet für die Existenz aller Dinge statt; mögen 
die Bewegungen geschwind, langsam oder Null sein.« 

Über den Raum äußert Newton ähnliche Ansichten; er sagt: 

»IL Der absolute Raum bleibt vermöge seiner Natur und ohne Be- 
ziehung auf einen äußeren Gegenstand stets gleich und unbeweglich.« 

»Der relative Raum ist ein Maß oder ein beweglicher Teil des ersteren, 
welcher von unseren Sinnen durch seine Lage gegen andere Körper be- 
zeichnet und gewöhnlich für den unbeweglichen Raum genommen wird.« 

» — — So bedienen wir uns, und nicht unpassend, in menschlichen 
Dingen statt der absoluten Orte und Bewegungen der relativen^ in der 
Naturlehre hingegen muß man von den Sinnen abstrahieren. Es kann 
nämlich der Fall sein, daß kein wirklich ruhender Körper existiert, auf 
welchen man die Orte und Bewegungen beziehen kann.« 

Die ausdrückliche, sowohl bei der Definition der absoluten Zeit als 
auch bei der des absoluten Raumes abgegebene Erklärung, daß diese »ohne 
Beziehung auf einen äußeren Gegenstand« existieren, mutet bei einem 
Forscher von Newtons Geistesrichtung fremdartig an ; betont er doch häufig, 
daß er nur das Tatsächliche, das durch Beobachtungen feststellbare, unter- 
suchen wolle. »Hypotheses non fingo« sind seine scharfen, deutlichen 
Worte. Aber etwas, was »ohne Beziehung auf einen äußeren Gegenstand« 
ist, ist doch nicht feststellbar, ist keine Tatsache. Hier liegt offenbar der 
Fall vor, daß Vorstellungen des naiven Bewußtseins ohne Kritik auf die 



46 



Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 



objektive Welt übertragen werden. Eine genauere Untersuchung dieser 
Frage werden wir erst später unternehmen. 

Unsere nächste Aufgabe ist, darzulegen, wie Newton die Gesetze des 
Kosmos auffaßte und worin der Fortschritt seiner Lehre besteht. 



Planet 



2. Newtons Anziehungsgesetz. 

Newtons Idee ist die dynamische Auffassung der Planetenbahnen oder, 
wie man heute sagt, die Begründung der Mechanik des Himmels. Dazu 
mußte der Galileische Kraftbegriff auf die Bewegungen der Gestirne über- 
tragen werden. Aber nicht durch Aufstellung kühner Hypothesen hat 
Newton das Gesetz, nach dem die Himmelskörper aufeinander wirken, 
gefunden, sondern auf dem systematischen, exakten Wege der Analyse der 
bekannten Tatsachen über die Planetenbewegungen. Diese Tatsachen 
waren in den drei Keplerschen Gesetzen ausgedrückt, die alle Beobach- 
tungen jenes Zeitalters in wunderbar knapper, anschaulicher Form zu- 
sammenfaßten. Wir müssen hier die Kepler- 
schen Gesetze in ausführlicher Form an- 
geben; sie lauten: 

1. Die Planeten bewegen sich in Ellip- 
sen um die Sonne als Brennpunkt 

(Abb. 33). 

2. Der von der Sonne nach einem 
Planeten gezogene Radiusvektor be- 
schreibt in gleichen Zeiten gleiche 
Flächenräume. 

3. Die Kuben der großen Bahnachsen 
verhalten sich wie die Quadrate der 
Umlaufszeiten. 

Das Grundgesetz der Mechanik stellt nun eine Beziehung her zwischen 
der Beschleunigung b der Bewegung und der Kraft K^ die die Bewegung 
verursacht. Die Beschleunigung b ist durch den Ablauf der Bewegung 
vollständig bestimmt, und wenn dieser bekannt ist, kann man b berechnen. 
Newton erkannte nun, daß die durch die Keplerschen Gesetze gegebene 
Bestimmung der Bahn gerade ausreicht, um die Beschleunigung b zu be- 
rechnen; damit ist dann die wirksame Kraft durch das Gesetz 

K=mb 
ebenfalls bekannt. 

Die übliche Mathematik seiner Zeit hätte Newton zur Ausführung dieser 
Rechnung nicht befähigt; er mußte selbst erst die mathematischen Hilfsmittel 
schaffen. So entstand in England die Differential- und Integralrechnung^ 
die Wurzel der gesamten modernen Mathematik, als Nebenprodukt der 
astronpmischen Forschung, während gleichzeitig Leibniz (1684) auf dem 
Kontinent von ganz anderen Gesichtspunkten ausgehend dieselben Me- 
thoden ersann. 




Abb. 33. 



Newtons Anziehungsgesetz. ^y 



Da wir in diesem Buche von der Infinitesimal-Mathematik keinen Ge- 
brauch machen, so können wir von der Großartigkeit der Newtonschen 
Schlußweisen auch keine Vorstellung vermitteln. Doch läßt sich der 
Grundgedanke an einem einfachen Falle klar machen. 

Die Planetenbahnen sind wenig exzentrische, kreisähnliche Ellipsen; 
es wird erlaubt sein, näherungsweise anzunehmen, die Planeten laufen auf 
Kreisen um die Sonne, wie es ja noch Kopernikus voraussetzte. Da 
Kreise spezielle Ellipsen mit der Exzentrizität Null sind, so ist durch diese 
Annahme das erste Keplersche Gesetz jedenfalls erfüllt. 

Dann besagt aber das zweite Keplersche Gesetz, daß jeder Planet 
seinen Kreis mit konstanter Geschwindigkeit durchläuft. Nun wissen wir 
über die Beschleunigung bei solchen Kreisbewegungen nach II, 4 genau 
Bescheid; sie ist nach dem Mittelpunkt gerichtet und hat nach der 
Formel (4), S. 22, den Wert 

r ' 

wenn v die Bahngeschwindigkeit, r der Kreisradius ist. 

Ist nun T die Umlaufszeit, so wird die Geschwindigkeit bestimmt als 
Verhältnis des Kreisumfanges 27rr(7ir = 3,1415...) zu der Zeit T, also 

(18) ""^^^^ 
so daß 

47r''r^ ^Tc'^r 

wird. 

Jetzt ziehen wir das dritte Keplersche Gesetz heran, das im Falle 
einer Kreisbahn offenbar aussagt, daß das Verhältnis des Würfels über 
dem Radius, r^, zum Quadrate der Umlaufszeit, T"", für alle Planeten 
denselben Wert C hat: 

(19) jr^ = C oder ^ = — . 



Setzen wir das oben ein, so erhalten wir 
(20) ^ = — ^. 

Danach hängt die Größe der Zentripetalbeschleunigung nur von der 
Entfernung des Planeten von der Sonne ab, und zwar ist sie umgekehrt 
proportional dem Quadrate der Entfernung, aber sie ist ganz unabhängig 
von den Eigenschaften des Planeten, etwa seiner Masse; denn die Größe C 
ist nach dem dritten Keplerschen Gesetz für alle Planeten dieselbe, sie 
kann also nur mit der Natur der Sonne etwas zu tun haben, nicht mit 
der des Planeten. 

Das merkwürdige ist nun, daß genau dasselbe Gesetz auch für die 
elliptischen Bahnen herauskommt, allerdings durch eine etwas mühsamere 



48 Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 

Rechnung. Immer ist die Beschleunigung auf die in einem Brennpunkte 
stehende Sonne gerichtet und hat den durch die Formel (20) angegebenen 
Betrag. 

3. Die allgemeine Gravitation. 

Das so gefundene Beschleunigungsgesetz hat nun eine wichtige Eigen- 
schaft mit der irdischen Schwerkraft gemein: es ist ganz unabhängig von 
der Natur des bewegten Körpers. Berechnet man aus der Beschleunigung 
die Kraft, so ist diese ebenfalls nach der Sonne gerichtet, ist also eine 
Anziehung und hat die Größe 

(21) K = mb = m ^ — ; 

sie ist der Masse des bewegten Körpers proportional, genau wie das 
Gewicht 

G = mg 
eines irdischen Körpers. 

Diese Tatsache legt nun den Gedanken nahe, daß beide Kräfte ein 
und desselben Ursprungs sind. Heute ist uns das durch die Jahrhun- 
derte alte Überlieferung so zur Selbstverständlichkeit geworden, daß wir 
uns kaum die Kühnheit und Größe der Newtonschen Idee vergegen- 
wärtigen können. Welche Phantasie gehört dazu, die Bewegung der Pla- 
neten um die Sonne oder des Mondes um die Erde als ein »Fallen« 
aufzufassen, das nach denselben Gesetzen und unter der Wirkung der- 
selben Kraft vor sich geht^ wie der Fall eines Steines aus meiner 
Hand! Daß die Planeten oder Monde tatsächlich nicht auf ihre Zen- 
tralkörper stürzen, beruht auf dem Trägheitsgesetz, das sich hier als 
Zentrifugal- oder Fliehkraft äußert; wir werden davon noch zu sprechen 
haben. 

Newton hat diesen Gedanken der allgemeinen Schwere oder Gravita- 
tion zuerst am Beispiel des Mondes geprüft, dessen Entfernung von der 
Erde durch Winkelmessungen bekannt war. 

Diese Feststellung ist so wichtig, daß wir die höchst einfache Rech- 
nung hier mitteilen wollen, als Bekräftigung der Tatsache, daß alle natur- 
wissenschaftlichen Ideen ihre Geltung und ihren Wert erst aus der Über- 
einstimmung berechneter und gemessener Zahlenwerte gewinnen. 

Der Zentralkörper ist jetzt die Erde, der Mond tritt an die Stelle des 
Planeten, r bedeutet den Radius der Mondbahn, T die Umlaufszeit des 
Mondes. Der Radius der Erdkugel sei a\ wenn dann die Schwerkraft 
auf der Erde mit der Anziehung, die der Mond von der Erde erfährt, 
denselben Ursprung haben soll, so muß sich die Schwerebeschleunigung g 
nach dem Newtonschen Gesetze (20) so ausdrücken: 

4 7c"C 



g 



a 



Die allgemeine Gravitation. 4Q 



WO C denselben Wert hat wie für den Mond, nämlich nach (19) 

C — 

Setzt man das ein, so erhält man 

(22) g = ^2^2 ■ 

Nun beträgt die »siderische« Umlaufszeit des Mondes, d. h. die Zeit 
zwischen zwei Stellungen, bei denen die Verbindungslinie Erde-Mond die- 
selbe Richtung zum Fixsternhimmel hat, 

7"= 27 Tage 7 Stunden 43 Minuten 12 Sekunden 
= 2360592 sec. 

Man pflegt in der Physik nur so viele Stellen einer Zahl anzuschreiben, 
als man bei der weiteren Rechnung gebrauchen will, und die übrigen als 
Potenzen von 10 anzudeuten. So schreiben wir hier 

T = 2, $6 ' 10^ sec. 

Der Abstand des Mondes vom Erdmittelpunkte ist etwa das 60 fache 
des Erdradius, genauer 

r = 60,1 a . 

Der Erdradius selbst ist leicht zu behalten, weil ja das metrische 
Maßsystem in einfacher Beziehung zu ihm steht. Es ist nämlich i m = 
100 cm der zehnmillionte Teil des Erdquadranten, also der 40 millionte 
oder 4 mal lo^te Teil des Erdumfanges 271a: 

2 na 

100 = =, 

4 • 10^ 

oder 

(23) a = 6,37 • 10^ cm. 

Setzt man das alles in die Formel (22) ein, so erhält man 

, , 4 TT^- 60, i^- 6,37 • 10^ „ , - 

(24) g = z.zb^'io''' = 98icm/sec. 

Dieser Wert stimmt aber genau mit dem überein, der durch irdische 
Pendelbeobachtungen gefunden worden ist (s. II, 12, S. 34). 

Die große Bedeutung dieses Resultats ist die, daß es die Relativierung 
der Schwerkraft darstellt. Für das antike Denken bedeutet die Schwere 
einen Zug nach dem absoluten »Unten«, den alle irdischen Körper er- 
fahren. Die Entdeckung der Kugelgestalt der Erde brachte die Relativie- 
rung der Richtung der irdischen Schwere; sie wurde ein Zug nach dem 
Erdmittelpunkte. 

Jetzt ist die Identität der irdischen Schwere mit der Anziehungskraft 
erwiesen, die den Mond in seine Bahn zwingt, und da kein Zweifel be- 
steht, daß diese wesensgleich ist mit der Kraft, die die Erde und die 
übrigen Planeten in ihre Bahnen um die Sonne zwingt, so entsteht die 

Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. a 



50 Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 

Vorstellung, daß Körper nicht »schwer« schlechthin, sondern gegenseitig 
oder relativ zueinander schwer sind. Die Erde als Planet wird nach der 
Sonne gezogen, zieht aber selbst den Mond an ; offenbar ist das nur eine 
angenäherte Beschreibung des wirklichen Sachverhalts, der darin besteht, 
daß Sonne, Erde und Mond sich gegenseitig anziehen. Allerdings ist für 
die Bahn der Erde um die Sonne diese als mit großer Annäherung 
ruhend zu betrachten^ weil ihre ungeheure Masse das Entstehen merk- 
licher Beschleunigungen verhindert, und umgekehrt kommt der Mond 
wegen seiner Kleinheit nicht merklich in Betracht. Eine genauere Theorie 
wird aber diese als »Störungen« bezeichneten Einflüsse berücksichtigen 
müssen. 

Ehe wir diese Auffassung, die den Hauptfortschritt der Newtonschen 
Theorie bedeutet, näher betrachten, wollen wir nun dem Newtonschen 
Gesetze seine endgültige Form geben. Wir sahen, daß ein Planet, der 
sich im Abstände r von der Sonne befindet, von dieser eine Anziehungs- 
kraft von der Größe (21) 

K^= m ^ 

r 

erfährt, wo C eine nur von den Eigenschaften der Sonne, nicht des 
Planeten abhängige Konstante ist. Nach der neuen Auffassung der wechsel- 
seitigen Schwere muß nun der Planet die Sonne ebenfalls anziehen; ist 
M die Sonnenmasse, c eine nur von der Natur des Planeten abhängige 
Konstante, so muß die auf die Sonne vom Planeten ausgeübte Kraft den 
Ausdruck 

K' = M^^^ 
r 

haben. Nun haben wir bereits früher, bei der Einführung des Kraft- 
begriffs (s. II, I, S. 14), von dem Prinzip der Gegenwirkung (actio = reactio) 
Gebrauch gemacht, das zu den einfachsten und sichersten Sätzen der 
Mechanik gehört. Wenden wir es hier an, so müssen wir K = K' setzen, 
oder 





m

2 /^ 2 
71 C ,^4^e 

r r 


Daraus folgt 






mC Mcj 


oder es gilt 






C c 
M m'' 



d. h. dieses Verhältnis hat für die beiden Körper (Sonne und Planet), 
also für alle Körper überhaupt, denselben Wert. Bezeichnen wir diesen 



mit -r, , so kann man 



(25) 47i^C=kM, /i^n^c = km 

schreiben; der Proportionalitätsfaktor k heißt die Gravitationskonstante. 



Die Mechanik des Himmels. 



51 



Dann bekommt das Newtonsche Gesetz der allgemeinen Gravitation 
die symmetrische Gestalt 

(26) K^k-^- 

es lautet in Worten: 

Zwei Körper ziehen sich gegenseitig an mit einer Kraft^ die der Masse 
jedes der Körper direkt und dem Quadrate ihres Abstandes umgekehrt 
proportional ist. 

4. Die Mechanik des Himmels. 

Erst in dieser allgemeinen Fassung bringt das Newtonsche Gesetz für 
die Berechnung der Planetenbahnen einen wirklichen Fortschritt. Denn 
in der ursprünglichen Form war es aus den Keplerschen Gesetzen durch 
Rechnung^ erschlossen und bedeutete nicht mehr als eine sehr kurze und 
prägnante Zusammenfassung dieser Gesetze. Man kann auch umgekehrt 
beweisen, daß die Bewegung eines Körpers um einen ruhenden Zentral- 
körper, der ihn nach dem Newtonschen Ge- 
setze anzieht, notwendig eine Keplersche ^^ ~^^:::;^AJon(f 

Ellipsenbewegung ist. Etwas neues ent- 
steht erst, wenn wir jetzt erstens beide 
Körper als beweglich ansehen und zweitens 
weitere Körper hinzunehmen. 

Dann entsteht die mathematische Aufgabe 
des Drei- oder Mehr- Körperproblems ^ die 
den tatsächlichen Verhältnissen im Planeten- 
system genau entspricht (Abb. 34). Die Abb. 34. 
Planeten werden ja nicht nur von der Sonne 

angezogen, die Monde nicht nur von ihren Planeten^ sondern jeder Körper, 
sei es Sonne, Planet, Mond, Komet, zieht jeden andern an. Danach 
erscheinen die Keplerschen Gesetze nur näherungsweise gültig, und zwar 
nur deswegen, weil die Anziehung der Sonne wegen ihrer großen Masse 
die Wechselwirkung aller übrigen Körper des Planetensystems bei weitem 
überwiegt. Aber in längeren Zeiträumen müssen sich auch diese Wechsel- 
wirkungen als Abweichungen von den Keplerschen Gesetzen bemerkbar 
machen; man spricht, wie schon gesagt, von »Störungen«. 

Zu Newtons Zeit waren solche Störungen bereits bekannt, und die 
folgenden Jahrhunderte haben durch Verfeinerung der Beobachtungs- 
methoden ein ungeheures Tatsachenmaterial angehäuft, das die Newton- 
sche Attraktionstheorie zu bewältigen hatte. Daß ihr das gelungen ist, 
ist einer der größten Triumphe des menschlichen Geistes. 

Es ist hier nicht unsere Aufgabe, die Entwicklung der Mechanik des 
Himmels von Newtons Zeiten bis heute zu verfolgen und die mathema- 
tischen Methoden darzustellen, die man zur Berechnung der »gestörten« 
Bahnen erdacht hat; die scharfsinnigsten Mathematiker aller Länder haben 




52 Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 



an der -i' Theorie der Störungen^ mitgewirkt, und wenn das Drei-Körper- 
problem auch noch keine vollkommen befriedigende Lösung gefunden hat, 
so kann man doch mit Sicherheit die Bewegungen auf Hunderttausende 
oder Millionen Jahre voraus oder zurück berechnen. In ungezählten Fällen 
wurde so die Newtonsche Theorie an neuen Erfahrungen geprüft, und sie 
hat bisher niemals versagt — außer in einem Falle, von dem gleich die 
Rede sein wird. Die theoretische Astronomie, wie sie Newton begründet 
hatte, galt daher lange als Vorbild der exakten Wissenschaften. Sie leistet 
das, was von jeher die Sehnsucht des Menschen war: sie lüftet den 
Schleier, der über der Zukunft gebreitet ist^ sie verleiht ihrem Jünger die 
Gabe der Prophetie. Ist der Gegenstand der astronomischen Weissagungen 
auch unwichtig, gleichgültig für das menschliche Leben, so wurde er ein 
Symbol für die Lösung des Geistes aus den Schranken irdischer Gebunden- 
heit; auch wir blicken gleich den Völkern aller Zeiten mit ehrfürchtiger 
Bewunderung zu den Gestirnen empor, die uns das Gesetz der Welt offen- 
baren. 

Das Weltgesetz aber kann keine Ausnahme dulden. Und doch gibt 
es, wie wir schon angedeutet haben, einen Fall, wo die Newtonsche Theorie 
versagt hat. Ist der Fehler auch klein, so ist er doch nicht wegzuleugnen. 
Es handelt sich um den Planeten Merkur, den der Sonne nächsten aller 
Wandelsterne. Die Bahn jedes Planeten kann man auffassen als eine 
Keplersche Ellipsenbewegung, die durch die übrigen Planeten gestört ist^ 
d. h. die Stellung der Bahnebene, die Lage der großen Achse der Ellipse, 
ihre Exzentrizität, kurz alle > Bahnelemente« erfahren allmähliche Ände- 
rungen. Wenn man diese durch 
Merkur Rechnung nach dem Newtonschen 

Gesetze ermittelt und an der be- 
obachteten Bahn anbringt, so muß 
sie sich in eine exakte Kepler- 
Perihei\^ Sohne j Bewegung verwandeln, d. h. in 

eine Ellipse in einer bestimmten, 
ruhenden Ebene, mit einer großen 
Achse von bestimmter Richtung 
Abb. 35. und Länge usw. Das ist auch bei 

allen Planeten der Fall; nur bei 
Merkur bleibt ein kleiner Rest. Die Richtung der großen Achse, das ist 
die Verbindungslinie der Sonne mit dem nächsten Bahnpunkte, dem Perihel 
(Abb. 35), steht nach Anbringung der Störungen nicht fest, sondern voll- 
führt eine ganz langsame Drehbewegung, in dem sie im Jahrhundert um 
43 Bogensekunden fortschreitet. Diese Bewegung hat der Astronom 
Leverrier (1845), — derselbe, der die Existenz des Planeten Neptun 
auf Grund von Störungsrechnungen vorhergesagt hat — zuerst berechnet 
und sie steht mit großer Sicherheit fest. Durch die Newtonsche An- 
ziehung der uns bekannten planetarischen Massen ist sie unerklärbar. 
Man hat daher zu hypothetischen Massen seine Zuflucht genommen, deren 




Das Relativitätsprinzip der klassischen Mechanik. Cß 

Anziehung die Perihelbewegung des Merkur erzeugen solle; so wurde z. B. 
das Tierkreis- oder Zodiakallicht, das von dünn verteilter, nebelartiger 
Materie in der Umgebung der Sonne herrühren soll, mit der Merkurano- 
malie in Verbindung gebracht. Diese und zahlreiche andere Hypothesen 
leiden aber alle an dem Mangel, daß sie ad hoc erfunden und durch 
keine andere Beobachtung bestätigt sind. 

Daß die einzige, ganz sicher gestellte Abweichung vom Newtonschen 
Gesetze gerade beim Merkur, dem sonnennächsten Planeten, auftritt, weist 
darauf hin, daß hier möglicherweise doch ein prinzipieller Mangel des 
Newtonschen Gesetzes vorliegt; denn die Anziehungskraft . ist in der Nähe 
der Sonne am größten, Abweichungen von dem Gesetze des umgekehrten 
Entfernungsquadrats werden sich also dort am ersten bemerklich machen. 
Man hat auch solche Abänderungen vorgenommen; aber da sie vollkommen 
willkürlich erfunden und durch keine anderen Tatsachen geprüft werden 
können, so wird ihre Richtigkeit nicht dadurch bewiesen, daß sie die 
Perihelbewegung des Merkur darstellen. Wenn die Newtonsche Theorie 
wirklich eine Verfeinerung erfordert, so muß man durchaus verlangen, daß 
sie ohne Einführung willkürlicher Konstanten aus einem Prinzipe fließt, 
das die bestehende Lehre an Allgemeinheit und innerer WahrscheinHch- 
keit übertrifft. 

Das ist erst Einstein gelungen, indem er die allgemeine Relativität 
als höchstes Postulat an die Spitze der Naturgesetze stellte. Wir werden 
im letzten Kapitel auf seine Erklärung der Perihelbewegung des Merkur 
zurückkommen. 

5. Das Relativitätsprinzip der klassischen Mechanik. 

Wir haben über den großen Problemen des Kosmos den irdischen 
Ausgangspunkt fast vergessen. Die auf der Erde gefundenen Gesetze der 
Dynamik wurden in den Weltenraum verlegt, durch den die Erde auf ihrer 
Bahn um die Sonne mit gewaltiger Geschwindigkeit dahinrast. Wie kommt 
es denn, daß wir von dieser Reise durch den Raum so wenig merken? 
Wie kommt es, daß Galilei auf der bewegten Erde Gesetze finden konnte, 
die nach Newton in Strenge nur im absolut ruhenden Räume gelten sollten ? 
Wir haben auf diese Frage schon oben angespielt, als von Newtons An- 
sichten über Raum und Zeit die Rede war. Wir sagten dort, daß die 
anscheinend gerade Bahn einer auf dem Tische rollenden Kugel in Wirk- 
lichkeit wegen der Erdrotation ein wenig gekrümmt sein muß, denn sie 
ist eben nicht gerade bezüglich der rotierenden Erde, sondern bezüglich 
des absoluten Raumes; daß man diese Krümmung nicht bemerkt, liegt 
an der Kürze des Weges und der Beobachtungszeit, während derer die 
Erde sich nur wenig gedreht hat. Sei dies zugegeben, so bleibt doch 
noch die Umlauf bewegung um die Sonne, die mit der gewaltigen Ge- 
schwindigkeit von etwa 30 km pro sec vor sich geht. Warum merkt man 
davon nichts? 



54 D^s Newtonsche Weltsystem. 



Diese Umlaufsbewegung ist zwar auch eine Rotation, und diese muß 
sich bei irdischen Bewegungen ähnlich bemerkbar machen, wie die Dre- 
hung der Erde um ihre eigene Achse, nur noch viel schwächer, weil die 
Krümmung der Erdbahn sehr gering ist. Wir meinen mit unserer Frage 
aber nicht diese Rotations-, sondern die Vorwärtsbewegung, die im Laufe 
eines Tages praktisch geradlinig und gleichförmig ist. 

Tatsächlich verlaufen alle mechanischen Vorgänge auf der Erde so, 
als wäre diese gewaltige Vorwärtsbewegung nicht vorhanden, und dieses 
Gesetz gilt ganz allgemein für jedes System von Körpern, das eine gleich- 
förmige und geradlinige Bewegung durch den Newtonschen absoluten Raum; 
ausführt. Man nennt es das Relativitätsprinzip der klassischen Mechanik 
es läßt sich auf verschiedene Weise formulieren; ein vorläufiger Wort- 
laut ist dieser: 

Die Gesetze der Mechanik lauten relativ zu einem geradlinig tmd gleich- 
förmig durch den absoluten Raum bewegten Koordinatensysteme genau ebenso^ 
wie relativ zu einem in dem Räume ruhenden Koordinatensysteme. 

Um die Richtigkeit dieses Satzes einzusehen, braucht man sich nur 
das mechanische Grundgesetz, den Impulssatz, und die darin vorkommen- 
den Begriffe klar vor Augen zu halten. Wir wissen, ein Stoß erzeugt eine 
Geschwindigkeits^>2^<?r//;2^; eine solche ist aber gänzlich davon unabhängig, 
ob die Geschwindigkeiten vor und nach dem Stoße, v^ und v^^ gegen 
den absoluten Raum oder gegen ein Bezugsystem beurteilt werden, das 
sich selber mit der konstanten Geschwindigkeit a bewegt. Schreitet der 
bewegte Körper vor dem Stoße im Räume etwa mit der Geschwindigkeit 
z'j = 5 cm/sec fort, so wird ein mit der Geschwindigkeit a = 2 cm/sec 
in derselben Richtung bewegter Beobachter nur die relative Geschwindig- 
keit v[ =^ v^ — ^=5 — 2 = 3 messen; erfährt der Körper jetzt einen 
Stoß in der Bewegungsrichtung, der seine Geschwindigkeit auf v^ = "j cm/sec 
vergrößert, so wird der bewegte Beobachter die Endgeschwindigkeit v'^ = 
v^ — a = >] — 2 = 5 messen. Die durch den Stoß hervorgerufene Ge- 
schwindigkeitsänderung ist also im ruhenden Räume w = v^ — ^i = 
7 — 5 = 2; dagegen stellt der bewegte Beobachter den Geschwindigkeits- 
zuwachs 

w' = V2 — v[ = {v^ — a) — [v^ — a) = v^ — v^ = w 
= 5 — 3=2 

fest: beide sind gleich groß. 

Genau dasselbe gilt für kontinuierliche Kräfte und die durch sie er- 
zeugten Beschleunigungen; denn die Beschleunigung b war definiert als 
Verhältnis der Geschwindigkeitsänderung w zu der dazu gebrauchten 
Zeit /, und da w davon unabhängig ist, welche geradlinige, gleichförmige 
Vorwärtsbewegung (Translationsbewegung) das zur Messung benutzte Bezug- 
system hat, so gilt dasselbe für b. 

Die Wurzel dieses Satzes ist offenbar das Trägheitsgesetz, wonach 
eine Translationsbewegung kräftefrei vonstatten geht; ein System von 



Der »eingeschränkt« absolute Raum. cc 



Körpern, die alle mit derselben konstanten Geschwindigkeit durch den 
Raum wandern, befindet sich also nicht nur geometrisch in relativer 
Ruhe, sondern es treten auch infolge der Bewegung keine Kraftwir- 
kungen auf die Körper des Systems auf. Wenn aber die Körper des 
Systems gegeneinander Kräfte ausüben, so werden die dadurch er- 
zeugten Bewegungen relativ genau so ablaufen, als wäre die gemein- 
same Translationsbewegung nicht vorhanden. Das System ist also für 
einen mitbewegten Beobachter von einem absolut ruhenden nicht unter- 
scheidbar. 

Die tägHch und tausendfältig wiederholte Erfahrung, daß wir von der 
Translationsbewegung der Erde nichts bemerken, ist ein handgreiflicher 
Beweis dieses Satzes. Aber auch bei irdischen Bewegungen zeigt sich 
dieselbe Tatsache; denn wenn eine Bewegung auf der Erde geradhnig 
und gleichförmig relativ zu dieser ist, so ist sie es auch gegen den 
Raum, wenn man bei der Erdbewegung selber von der Rotation absieht. 
Jeder weiß, daß in einem gleichmäßig fahrenden Schiffe oder Eisenbahn- 
wagen die mechanischen Vorgänge in derselben Weise ablaufen, wie auf 
der ruhenden Erde; auch auf dem fahrenden Schiffe fällt z. B. ein Stein 
vertikal, und zwar längs einer mitbewegten vertikalen Geraden, herab. 
Würde die Fahrt völlig gleichmäßig und erschütterungsfrei vor sich gehen, 
so würden die Passagiere nichts von der Bewegung merken, solange sie 
nicht die vorbeiziehende Umgebung beachten. 

6. Der »eingeschränkt« absolute Raum. 

Der Satz von der Relativität der mechanischen Vorgänge ist der Aus- 
gangspunkt für alle unsere weiteren Betrachtungen. Seine Wichtigkeit 
beruht darauf, daß er mit den Newtonschen Anschauungen über den ab- 
soluten Raum aufs engste zusammenhängt und die physische Realität 
dieses Begriffs gleich von vornherein wesentlich einschränkt. 

Wir haben die Notwendigkeit der Annahme des absoluten Raumes 
und der absoluten Zeit oben damit begründet, daß ohne sie das Träg- 
heitsgesetz überhaupt keinen Sinn hat. Wir müssen jetzt der Frage 
nähertreten, wieweit diesen Begriffen das Merkmal der > Wirklichkeit« im 
Sinne der Physik zukommt. Physikahsche Realität hat aber ein Begriff 
nur dann, wenn ihm irgend etwas durch Messungen feststellbares in der 
Welt der Erscheinungen entspricht. Es ist hier nicht der Ort, sich mit 
dem philosophischen Begriffe der Wirklichkeit auseinanderzusetzen. Jeden- 
falls steht ganz fest, daß das eben angegebene Wirklichkeitskriterium 
durchaus dem Gebrauche der physikalischen Wissenschaften entspricht; 
jeder Begriff, der ihm nicht genügt, ist allmählich aus dem System der 
Physik verdrängt worden. 

Wir sehen nun sogleich, daß in diesem Sinne ein bestimmter Ort in 
Newtons absolutem Räume nichts Wirkliches ist; denn es ist prinzipiell 
unmöglich, im Räume einen Ort' wiederzufinden. 



c5 Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 

Das geht ohne weiteres aus dem Relativitätsprinzip hervor; ange- 
nommen, man wäre irgendwie zu der Annahme gelangt, daß ein bestimmtes 
Bezugsystem im Räume ruhte, so kann ein relativ zu diesem gleichförmig 
und geradlinig bewegtes Bezugsystem mit demselben Rechte als ruhend 
angesehen werden. Die mechanischen Vorgänge in beiden verhalten sich 
vollkommen gleich, keines der beiden Systeme ist vor dem andern aus- 
gezeichnet. Ein bestimmter Körper, der in dem einen Bezugsystem 
ruhend erscheint, beschreibt, von dem andern System aus gesehen, eine 
geradlinige und gleichförmige Bewegung, und wenn jemand also behaupten 
wollte, dieser Körper markiere einen Ort im absoluten Räume, so könnte 
ein anderer mit demselben Rechte das bestreiten und den Körper für 
bewegt erklären. 

Damit verliert aber der absolute Raum Newtons bereits einen beträcht- 
lichen Teil seiner etwas unheimlichen Existenz; ein Raum, in dem es 
keine Orte gibt, die man mit irgendwelchen physischen Mitteln markieren 
kann, ist jedenfalls ein recht subtiles Gebilde, nicht einfach ein Kasten, 
in den die materiellen Dinge hineingestopft sind. 

Wir müssen nun auch den Wortlaut des Relativitätsprinzips abändern; 
denn darin wurde noch von einem im absoluten Räume ruhenden Koor- 
dinatensysteme gesprochen, was offenbar physikalisch sinnlos ist. Um 
zu einer klaren Formulierung zu gelangen, hat man den Begriff des 
Inertialsy Sterns (inertia = Trägheit) eingeführt und versteht darunter ein 
Koordinatensystem, in dem das Trägheitsgesetz in seiner ursprüngHchen 
Fassung gilt; es gibt eben nicht nur das eine, in dem absoluten Räume 
Newtons ruhende System, wo das der Fall ist, sondern unendlich viele 
Bezugsysteme, die sämtHch gleichberechtigt sind, und da man nicht gut 
von mehreren, gegeneinander bewegten »Räumen« sprechen kann, so zieht 
man vor, das Wort Raum möglichst ganz zu vermeiden. Dann nimmt 
das Relativitätsprinzip die folgende Fassung an : 

Es gibt uftendlich viele ^ relativ zueinander in Translationsbewegungen 
befindliche, gleichberechtigte Systeme^ Inertialsy steme^ in denen die Gesetze 
der Mechanik in ihrer einfachen^ klassischen Form gelten. 

Hier sieht man klar, wie das Problem des Raumes aufs engste mit 
der Mechanik verknüpft ist. Nicht der Raum ist da und prägt den 
Dingen seine >Form« auf, sondern die Dinge und ihre physikalischen 
Gesetze bestimmen erst den Raum. Wir werden sehen, wie diese Auf- 
fassung sich immer klarer und umfassender durchsetzt, bis sie in der all- 
gemeinen Relativitätstheorie Einsteins ihren Höhepunkt erreicht. 

7. Galilei-Transformationen. 

Wenn auch die Gesetze der Mechanik in allen Inertialsystemen gleich 
lauten, so folgt daraus natürhch nicht, daß Koordinaten und Geschwindig- 
keiten der Körper bezüglich zweier relativ zueinander bewegter Inertial- 
systeme gleich sind; denn wenn z. B. ein Körper in einem Systeme S ruht.

SO hat er gegen das andere relativ zu S bewegte System S' eine konstante 
Geschwindigkeit. Die allgemeinen Gesetze der Mechanik enthalten nur die 
Beschleunigungen, und diese sind, wie wir gesehen haben, für alle Inertial- 
systeme gleich; für Koordinaten und Geschwindigkeiten gilt das nicht. 

Daher entsteht das Problem, 
wenn die Lage und der Geschwindig- 
keitszustand eines Körpers in einem 
Inertialsysteme S gegeben sind, sie 
für ein anderes Inertialsystem S' zu 
finden. 

Es handelt sich also um den 
Übergang von einem Koordinaten- 
system zu einem andern, und zwar 
einem relativ dazu bewegten. Wir 
müssen hier einige Bemerkungen 
über gleichberechtigte Koordinaten- 
systeme im allgemeinen und die Ge- 
setze der Umrechnung von einem auf 
das andere, die sogenannten Trans- 
formationsgleichungen ^ einschalten. 

Das Koordinatensystem ist in der Geometrie ein Mittel, relative Lagen 
eines Körpers gegen einen andern in bequemer Weise zu fixieren. Dazu 
denkt man sich das Koordinatensystem fest mit dem einen Körper ver- 
bunden; dann bestimmen die Koordinaten der Punkte des andern Körpers 
die relative Lage vollständig. Gleichgültig ist dabei natürlich, ob das 
Koordinatensystem rechtwinklig, 
schiefwinklig, polar oder noch 
allgemeiner gewählt wird ; gleich- 
gültig ist auch, wie es zu dem 
ersten Körper orientiert ist. Nur 
muß man entweder diese Orien- 
tierung festhalten, oder, wenn 
man sie wechselt, genau an- 
geben, wie man das Koordi- 
natensystem gegen den Körper 
verlagert. Wenn man z. B. in 
der Ebene mit rechtwinkligen 
Koordinaten operiert, so kann 
man statt des zuerst gewählten 
Systems S ein zweites S' wählen, 

das gegen S verschoben (Abb. 36) oder gedreht (Abb. 37) ist; man muß 
aber genau angeben, wie groß die Verschiebung und die Drehung ist. 
Aus diesen Angaben läßt sich dann berechnen, wie die Koordinaten eines, 
Punktes P, die im alten System S die Werte x, y hatten, im neuen System 
S' lauten; nennt man sie x'^ y\ so erhält man Formeln, die erlauben

x\ y aus x^ y zu berechnen. Wir wollen das für den allerem fachsten 
Fall ausführen, nämlich den, wo das System *S' aus S durch eine Parallel- 
verschiebung um den Betrag a in der .;i;-Richtung entsteht (Abb. 38); 
dann wird offenbar die neue Koordinate x eines Punktes P gleich seiner 

alten x^ vermindert um die Ver- 
\y Schiebung a^ während die y-Koor- 

dinate ungeändert bleibt. Es

Ähnliche, nur kompliziertere 
Trans formationsform ein gelten für 
andere Fälle; wir werden später 
noch davon ausführlicher zu reden 
haben. Wichtig ist die Einsicht, 
daß jede Größe, die eine geo- 
metrische Bedeutung an sich hat, 
von der Wahl des Koordinaten- 
systems unabhängig sein und da- 
her in gleichartigen Koordinaten- 



systemen sich gleichartig ausdrücken muß. Man sagt, eine solche Größe 
sei invariant gegen die betreffende Koordinaten- Transformation. Be- 
trachten wir als Beispiel die eben erörterte Transformation (27), die eine 
Verschiebung längs der^-Achse ausdrückt; so ist klar, daß dabei der Unter-

schied der jc- Koordinaten zweier Punkte F und Q^ x^—^z-, sich nicht 
ändert; in der Tat ist (Abb. 39) 

x'^—x[ = (x^ — a) — (x^ — öt) = ^2 — ^i •

Variante (Abb. 40). Er hat in beiden Systemen denselben Ausdruck, denn 
nach dem pythagoräischen Lehrsatze gilt 

28) s = X -i-y = X -\-y . 

In dem allgemeineren Falle der gleichzeitigen Verschiebung und Dre- 
hung des Koordinatensystems wird der Abstand zweier Punkte jP, Q 
invariant sein. Die Invarianten sind dadurch besonders wichtig, daß sie 
geometrische Verhältnisse an sich darstellen, ohne Bezug auf die zufällige 
Wahl des Koordinatensystems. Sie werden im folgenden eine beträcht- 
liche Rolle spielen. 

Kehren wir nun von dieser geometrischen Abschweifung zu dem Aus- 
gangspunkte zurück, so haben wir die Frage zu beantworten, welches die 
Transformationsgesetze für den Übergang von einem Inertialsystem zu 
einem andern sind. 

Das Inertialsystem definierten wir als ein Koordinatensystem, in dem 
das Trägheitsgesetz gilt; wesentlich ist dabei nur der Bewegungszustand, 
nämlich das Fehlen von Beschleunigungen gegen den absoluten Raum, 
unwesentlich aber die Art und Lage des Koordinatensystems. Wählt man 
es, wie es am häufigsten geschieht, als rechtwinkliges, so bleibt noch immer 
dessen Lage frei; man kann ein verschobenes oder gedrehtes System nehmen, 
nur muß es denselben Bewegungszastand haben. Wir haben schon im 
Voraufgehenden immer dort, wo es nur auf den Bewegungszustand, nicht 
auf die Art und Lage des Koordinatensystems ankommt, von Bezugsystem 
gesprochen und werden diese Bezeichnung von jetzt an systematisch ver- 
wenden. 

Bewegt sich nun das Inertialsystem S' geradlinig gegen S mit der 
Geschwindigkeit v^ so können wir in beiden Bezugsystemen rechtwinklige 
Koordinaten so wählen, daß die Bewegungsrichtung die x- bzw. A:'-Achse 
wird. Ferner können wir annehmen, daß zur Zeit / = o die Nullpunkte 
beider Systeme zusammenfallen. Dann hat sich der Nullpunkt des S'- 
Systems in der Zeit / um a = vt in der :r-Richtung verschoben; in 
diesem Augenblick haben also die beiden Systeme genau die Lage, die 
oben rein geometrisch behandelt worden ist, es gelten also die Gleichungen 
(27), wobei a =^ vt zu setzen ist. Mithin erhält man die Transformations- 
gleichungen 

(29) x' =^ X — vt, y = _>', z = s, 

wobei die unveränderte s-Koordinate mit angeschrieben ist. Man nennt 
dieses Gesetz eine Galilei- Transformation zu Ehren des Begründers der 
Mechanik. 

Man kann nun das Relativitätsprinzip auch so aussprechen: 
Die Gesetze der Mechanik sind invariant gegen Galilei- Transformationen. 
Das kommt daher, daß die Beschleunigungen invariant sind, wie wir 
schon oben durch Betrachtung der Geschwindigkeitsänderung eines be- 
wegten Körpers relativ zu zwei Inertialsystemen eingesehen haben. 



6o 



Das Newtonsche Weltsystem. 



Wir haben früher gezeigt, daß die Bewegungslehre oder Kinematik als 
Geometrie im vierdimensionalen xy z f-RsLume , der »Welt« Minkowskis, 
angesehen werden kann. Daher ist es nicht ohne Interesse, zu überlegen, 
was die Inertialsysteme und Galilei-Transformationen in dieser vierdimen- 
sionalen Geometrie bedeuten. Das ist durchaus nicht schwierig; denn 
die y- und s-Koordinate gehen in die Transformation gar nicht ein ; es 
genügt also in der ::t: /-Ebene zu operieren. 

Wir stellen ein Inertialsystem S durch ein rechtwinkliges ^/-Koordi- 
natensystem dar (Abb. 41). Einem zweiten Inertialsystem S' entspricht 
dann ein anderes Koordinatensystem x i\ und es fragt sich, wie dieses 
aussieht und wie es zu dem ersten liegt. Zunächst ist das Zeitmaß des 
zweiten Systems S' genau dasselbe wie das des ersten, nämlich die eine, 
absolute Zeit / = /'; also fällt die ::i;- Achse, auf welcher t = o ist, mit 
der ::t:' -Achse /' = o zusammen. Folglich kann das System S' nur ein 
schiefwinkliges Koordinatensystem sein. Die /'-Achse ist die Weltlinie 
des Punktes x = o, d. h. des Nullpunkts des Systems S'', die :\;-Koordi- 
nate dieses Punktes, der sich mit der Geschwindigkeit v relativ zum 

System S bewegt, ist in diesem 
System zur Zeit / gleich vf. Für 
irgendeinen Weltpunkt I* ergibt 
dann die Figur ohne weiteres die 
Formel der GaHlei-Transformation 
x' = X — vt 

Irgendeinem andern Inertial- 
systeme entspricht ein anderes, 
schiefwinkliges :v /-Koordinaten- 
system mit derselben ^-Achse, aber 
anders geneigter /-Achse. Das 
rechtwinklige System, von dem wir 
ausgingen, hat unter allen diesen 
schiefwinkligen keinerlei Vorzugs- 
stellung. Die Zeiteinheit wird auf 
allen /-Achsen der verschiedenen 
Koordinatensysteme durch dieselbe Parallele zur :j?- Achse abgeschnitten; das 
ist gewissermaßen die »Eichkurve« der :v /-Ebene bezüglich der Zeit. 
Wir fassen das Ergebnis zusammen: 

In der xt-Ebe7ie ist die Wahl der Richtung der t- Achse ganz willkür- 
lich. In jedem schiefwinkligen xt- Koordinatensystem mit derselben x- Achse 
gelten die mechanischen Grundgesetze. 

Vom geometrischen Standpunkte ist diese Mannigfaltigkeit gleichwertiger 
Koordinatensysteme höchst sonderbar und ungewohnt; insbesondere ist 
die feste Lage oder Invarianz der ^-Achse merkwürdig. Wenn man in 
der Geometrie mit schiefwinkligen Koordinaten operiert, liegt gewöhnlich 
kein Grund vor, die Lage der einen Achse festzuhalten. Das wird aber 
physikahsch durch den Newtonschen Grundsatz von der absoluten Zeit 




Abb. 41. 



Trägheitskräfte. 6 1 



gefordert. Alle Ereignisse, die gleichzeitig, bei demselben Werte von /, 
stattfinden, werden durch eine Parallele zur ^- Achse dargestellt; da nach 
Newton die Zeit »absolut und ohne Bezug auf irgendwelche Gegenstände« 
abläuft, so müssen gleichzeitigen Ereignissen in allen zulässigen Koordi- 
natensystemen dieselben Weltpunkte entsprechen. 

Wir werden sehen, daß diese Unsymmetrie des Verhaltens der Welt- 
koordinaten X und /, hier nur als Schönheitsfehler gewertet, tatsächlich 
gar nicht vorhanden ist. Einstein hat sie durch seine Relativierung des 
Zeitbegriffs beseitigt. 

8. Trägheitskräfte. 

Nachdem wir erkannt haben, daß den einzelnen Orten in Newtons 
absolutem Räume jedenfalls keine physikalische Realität zukommt, werden 
wir fragen, was dann überhaupt von diesem Begrifie übrig bleibt. Nun, 
er macht sich doch recht deutlich und kräftig bemerkbar , denn der Wider- 
stand aller Körper gegen Beschleunigungen muß im Sinne Newtons als 
Wirkung des absoluten Raumes gedeutet werden. Die Lokomotive, die 
den Zug in Bewegung setzt^ muß den Trägheitswiderstand überwinden; 
das Geschoß, das eine Mauer zertrümmert, schöpft aus der Trägheit seine 
zerstörende Kraft. Trägheitswirkungen entstehen, wo Beschleunigungen 
stattfinden, und diese sind nichts als Geschwindigkeitsänderungen im ab- 
soluten Räume; man kann hier dieses Wort gebrauchen, denn eine Ge- 
schwindigkeitsänderung hat in allen Inertialsystemen denselben Wert. 
Bezugsysteme, die selbst gegen die Inertialsysteme beschleunigt sind, sind 
also mit diesen und untereinander nicht gleichwertig; man kann natürlich 
auch die Gesetze der Mechanik auf sie beziehen, aber sie nehmen dann 
eine neue, verwickeitere Form an. Schon die Bahn eines sich selbst über- 
lassenen Körpers ist in einem beschleunigten Systeme nicht geradlinig und 
gleichförmig (s. III, i, S. 44); man kann das auch so ausdrücken, daß 
man sagt: in einem beschleunigten Systeme greifen außer den eigentlichen 
Kräften noch scheinbare Kräfte^ Trägheitskräfte ^ an; ein Körper, auf den 
keine wirklichen Kräfte wirken, unterliegt doch diesen Trägheitskräften, 
seine Bewegung ist daher im allgemeinen weder gleichförmig noch ge- 
radlinig. Ein solches beschleunigtes System ist z. B. ein Wagen während 
des Anfahrens oder Bremsens; ein jeder kennt von Eisenbahnfahrten den 
Ruck bei der Abfahrt oder Ankunft, dieser ist nichts als die Trägheits- 
kraft, von der wir eben gesprochen haben. 

Wir wollen die Erscheinungen im einzelnen für ein geradlinig bewegtes 
System S betrachten, dessen Beschleunigung konstant gleich k sein soll. 
Messen wir nun die Beschleunigung b eines Körpers gegen dieses bewegte 
System S^ so ist die Beschleunigung gegen den absoluten Raum offenbar 
um k größer; daher lautet das dynamische Grundgesetz, bezogen auf 
den Raum 

m[b-\-k)=K, 



62 Das Newtonsche Weltsystem, 

Schreibt man dieses nun in der Form 

mb = K — mk , 

so kann man sagen, in dem beschleunigten Systeme S gilt wiederum ein 
Bewegungsgesetz der Newtonschen Form 

mb == ä", 

nur ist für die Kraft K' die Summe 

K'=K—mk 

zu setzen, wo K die wirkliche, — mk die scheinbare oder Trägheits- 
kraft ist. 

Wenn nun keine wirkliche Kraft da, also K=o ist, so wird die 
Gesamtkraft gleich der Trägheitskraft 

(30) K' = — mk. 

Diese greift also an einem sich selbst überlassenen Körper an. Man 
kann ihre Wirkung durch folgende Überlegung erkennen: Wir wissen, 
daß die irdische Schwerkraft, das Gewicht, durch die Formel G = mg 
bestimmt ist, wo g die konstante Schwerebeschleunigung ist. Die Träg- 
heitskraft K' = — mk wirkt also genau so, wie die Schwere; das Minus- 
zeichen bedeutet, daß die Kraft der Beschleunigung des zugrunde ge- 
legten Bezugsystems S entgegengerichtet ist, die Größe der scheinbaren 
Schwerebeschleunigung k ist gleich der Beschleunigung des Bezugsystems S. 
Die Bewegung eines sich selbst überlassenen Körpers im System S ist 
also einfach eine Fall- oder Wurfbewegung. 

Dieser Zusammenhang der Trägheitskräfte in beschleunigten Systemen 
und der Schwerkraft erscheint hier noch ganz zufällig; tatsächlich ist er 
auch zwei Jahrhunderte lang unbeachtet geblieben. Wir wollen aber schon 
hier sagen, daß er das Fundament der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie 
Einsteins bildet. 

9. Die Fliehkräfte und der absolute Raum. 

In Newtons Auffassung beweist das Auftreten der Trägheitskräfte in 
beschleunigten Systemen die Existenz des absoluten Raumes, oder besser 
die bevorzugte Stellung der Inertialsysteme. Besonders deutlich treten 
die Trägheitskräfte in rotierenden Bezugsystemen in Erscheinung, in der 
Form der Flieh- oder Zentrifugalkräfte. Auf sie stützte Newton vor allem 
seine Lehre vom absoluten Räume; zitieren wir seine eigenen Worte: 

»Die wirkenden Ursachen, durch welche absolute und relative Be- 
wegung voneinander verschieden sind, sind die Fliehkräfte von der Achse 
der Bewegung (weg). Bei einer nur relativen Kreisbewegung existieren 
diese Kräfte nicht, aber sie sind kleiner oder größer, je nach Verhältnis 
der Größe der (absoluten) Bewegung.« 

»Man hänge z. B. ein Gefäß an einem sehr langen Faden auf, drehe 
denselben beständig im Kreise herum, bis der Faden durch die Drehung

Q.^ 




sehr steif wird (Abb. 42); hierauf fülle man es mit Wasser und halte es 
zugleich mit letzterem in Ruhe. Wird es nun durch eine plötzlich wir- 
kende Kraft in entgegengesetzte Kreisbewegung gesetzt und hält diese, 
während der Faden sich löst, längere Zeit an, so wird die Oberfläche 
des Wassers anfangs eben sein, wie vor der Bewegung des Gefäßes, 
hierauf, wenn die Kraft allmählich auf 
das Wasser einwirkt, bewirkt das Gefäß, 
daß dieses (das Wasser) merklich sich 
mitzudrehen anfängt. Es entfernt sich 
nach und nach von der Mitte und steigt 
an den Wänden des Gefäßes in die 
Höhe, in dem es eine hohle Form an- 
nimmt. (Diesen Versuch habe ich selbst 
gemacht.)« 

» Im Anfang, als die relative 

Bewegung des Wassers im Gefäß (gegen 
die Wandung) am größten war, verur- 
sachte dieselbe kein Bestreben, sich von 
der Achse zu entfernen. Das Wasser 
suchte nicht, sich dem Umfange zu 
nähern, indem es an den Wänden empor- 
stieg, sondern blieb eben, und die zvahre 
kreisförmige Bewegung hatte daher noch 

nicht begonnen. Nachher aber, als die relative Bewegung des Wassers ab- 
nahm, deutete sein Aufsteigen an den Wänden des Gefäßes das Bestreben 
an, von der Achse zurückzuweichen, und dieses Bestreben zeigte die stets 
wachsende wahre Kreisbewegung des Wassers an, bis diese endlich am 
größten wurde, wenn das Wasser selbst relativ im Gefäße ruhte. < 

» — — Die wahren Bewegungen der einzelnen Körper zu erkennen 
und von den scheinbaren zu unterscheiden, ist übrigens sehr schwer, weil 
die Teile jenes unbeweglichen Raumes, in denen die Körper sich wahr- 
haft bewegen, nicht sinnlich erkannt werden können.« 

>Die Sache ist jedoch nicht gänzlich hoffnungslos. Es ergeben sich 
nämlich die erforderlichen Hilfsmittel teils aus den scheinbaren Bewe- 
gungen, welche die Unterschiede der wahren sind, teils aus den Kräften, 
welche den wahren Bewegungen als wirkende Ursachen zugrunde liegen. 
Werden z. B. zwei Kugeln in gegebener gegenseitiger Entfernung mittels 
eines Fadens verbunden und so um 
den gewöhnlichen Schwerpunkt ge- 
dreht (Abb. 43), so erkennt man aus 

der Spannung des Fadens das Streben Abb. 43. 

der Kugeln, sich von|der Achse der 

Bewegung zu entfernen, und kann daraus die Größe der kreisförmigen 
Bewegung erkennen. . . . Auf diese Weise könnte man sowohl die Größe 
als auch die Richtung ^dieser kreisförmigen Bewegung in jedem unend-

lieh großen leeren Raum finden, wenn auch nichts Äußerliches und 
Erkennbares sich dort befände, womit die Kugeln verglichen werden 
könnten.« — 

Diese Worte bringen den Sinn des absoluten Raumes aufs deutlichste 
zum Ausdruck; wir haben ihnen nur wenige Erläuterungen hinzuzufügen. 

Was zunächst die quantitativen Verhältnisse bei den Fliehkräften an- 
langt, so können wir diese sofort übersehen, wenn wir uns an die Größe 
und Richtung der Beschleunigung bei Kreisbewegungen erinnern ; sie war 
nach dem Zentrum gerichtet und hatte nach der Formel (4), S. 22, den Betrag 

b = — , wo r den Kreisradius, v die Geschwindigkeit bedeuten. 
r 

Haben wir nun ein rotierendes Bezugsystem S, das sich in Z'sec 

einmal herumdreht, so ist die Geschwindigkeit eines im Abstände r von 

der Achse befindlichen Punktes [s. Formel (18), S. 47] 

7.7tr 



T ' 
also ist die Beschleunigung nach der Achse hin, die wir mit k bezeichnen 

(s. S. 47): 



k =

Hat nun ein Körper relativ zu S die Beschleunigung b^ so ist seine 
absolute Beschleunigung b -\- k\ genau wie oben bei der geradlinigen, 

beschleunigten Bewegung ergibt sich dann 
die Existenz einer scheinbaren Kraft von 
der absoluten Größe

die von der Drehachse fortgerichtet ist. 
Das ist die Zentrifugalkraft, 

Es ist bekannt, daß unter den Be- 
weisen für die Erddrehung auch die 
Zentrifugalkraft eine Rolle spielt (Abb. 
44). Sie treibt die Massen von der 
Rotationsachse fort und bewirkt da- 
durch erstens die Abplattung der Erde an den Polen, zweitens die Ab- 
nahme der Schwere vom Pol nach dem Äquator hin. Letztere Er- 
scheinung haben wir schon oben kennen gelernt, als von der Wahl der 
Krafteinheit die Rede war (II, 15, S. 41), ohne daß wir auf ihre Ursache 
eingegangen sind. Nach Newton ist sie ein Beweis für die Erdrotation; 
die nach außen ziehende Zentrifugalkraft wirkt der Schwere entgegen und 
verringert das Gewicht, und zwar hat die Abnahme der Schwerebeschleuni-

6,37 • 10^ cm und für die Rotationsdauer 2^= i Tag = 24 • 60 • 60 sec = 
86 4oosec, so erhält man für den Unterschied der Schwerebeschleunigung 
am Pol und am Äquator den gegen 981 relativ kleinen Wert 3,37 cm/sec^; 
dieser ist übrigens noch wegen der Abplattung der Erde etwas zu ver- 
größern. 

Nach Newtons Lehre vom absoluten Räume sind diese Erscheinungen 
durchaus so aufzufassen, daß sie nicht auf der relativen Bewegung gegen 
andere Massen, etwa die Fixsterne, beruhen, sondern auf der absoluten 
Drehung gegen den leeren Raum. Würde 
die Erde ruhen, der ganze Fixstern- 
himmel aber im umgekehrten Sinne inner^ 
halb 24 Stunden um die Erdachse ro- 
tieren, so würden nach Newton die 
Zentrifugalkräfte nicht auftreten; die 
Erde wäre nicht abgeplattet und die 
Schwerkraft wäre am Äquator ebenso- 
groß wie am Pol. Der Anblick der Be- 
wegung des Himmels von der Erde aus 
wäre in beiden Fällen genau der gleiche ; 
und doch soll ein bestimmter, physika- 
lisch feststellbarer Unterschied zwischen 
ihnen besteben. 

Noch krasser tritt das vielleicht bei dem Foucaultschen Pendel- 
versuch (1850) hervor. Ein in einer Ebene schwingendes Pendel muß 
nach den Gesetzen der Newtonschen Dynamik seine Schwingungsebene im 
absoluten Räume dauernd beibehalten, wenn man alle ablenkenden Kräfte 
ausschließt. Hängt man das Pendel am 
Nordpol auf, so dreht sich die Erdkugel 
gewissermaßen unter ihm fort (Abb. 45); 
der Beobachter auf der Erde bemerkt 
also eine Drehung der Schwingungs- 
ebene im entgegengesetzten Sinne. Würde 
die Erde ruhen, aber das Fixsternsystem 
sich drehen, so dürfte nach Newton die 
Schwingungsebene des Pendels sich 
gegen die Erde nicht verlagern. Daß 
sie es tut, beweist also wieder die abso- 
lute Rotation der Erde. 

Wir wollen noch ein Beispiel betrachten, die Bewegung des Mondes 
um die Erde (Abb. 46). Nach Newton würde der Mond auf die Erde 
fallen, wenn er nicht eine absolute Rotation um diese hätte. Denken 
wir uns ein Koordinatensystem mit dem Erdmittelpunkte als Nullpunkt, 
dessen ^cjj' -Ebene die Mondbahn sei und dessen ;c-Achse dauernd durch 
den Mond gehe. Würde dieses System absolut ruhen, so würde auf den

diese erzeugt eine Zentrifugalkraft, die der Kraft K das Gleichgewicht

Ganz Entsprechendes gilt natürlich auch für die Drehung der Planeten 
um die Sonne. 

Diese und viele andere Beispiele zeigen, daß Newtons Lehre vom 
absoluten Räume sich auf sehr konkrete Tatsachen stützt. Gehen wir die 
Gedankenreihe noch einmal durch^ so sehen wir folgendes: 

Das Beispiel mit dem rotierenden Wasserglas zeigt, daß die relative 
Drehung des Wassers gegen das Glas an dem Auftreten der Fliehkräfte 
nicht schuld ist. Es könnte sein, daß größere umgebende Massen, etwa 
die ganze Erde, die Ursache sind. Die Abplattung der Erde, die Abnahme 
der Schwere am Äquator, der Foucaultsche Pendelversuch zeigen, daß die 
Ursache außerhalb der Erde zu suchen ist. Die Bahnen aller Monde und 
Planeten existieren aber ebenfalls nur auf Grund von Zentrifugalkräften, 
die der Gravitation das Gleichgewicht halten. Und schließlich bemerkt 
man dieselbe Erscheinung bei den fernsten Doppel Sternen, von denen das 
Licht Jahrtausende bis zu uns braucht. Es scheint also, als wenn das 
Auftreten der Fhehkräfte universell ist und nicht auf Wechselwirkungen 
beruhen kann. Darum bleibt nichts übrig, als den absoluten Raum als 
ihre Ursache anzunehmen. 

Solche Schlußweisen haben seit Newton allgemeine Geltung gehabt. 
Nur wenige Denker haben sich gegen sie gewehrt. Da ist vor allem und 
fast allein Ernst Mach zu nennen; dieser hat in seiner kritischen Dar- 
stellung der Mechanik die Newtonschen Begriffe zerlegt und auf ihre Er- 
kenntniskraft geprüft. Er geht davon aus, daß mechanische Erfahrung 



Die Fliehkräfte und der absolute Raum. 6? 

niemals etwas über den absoluten Raum lehren kann; feststellbar und 
darum physikalisch wirklich sind nur relative Orte, relative Bewegungen. 
Darum müssen Newtons Beweise für die Existenz des absoluten Raumes 
Scheinbeweise sein. In der Tat kommt alles darauf an, ob man zugibt, 
daß bei einer Drehung des ganzen Fixsternhimmels um die Erde keine 
Abplattung, keine Schwereverminderung am Äquator usw. eintreten würden. 
Mit Recht sagt Mach, daß solche Behauptungen weit über jede mögliche 
Erfahrung herausgehen; er macht es Newton sehr energisch zum Vorwurf, 
daß er hier seinem Prinzipe, nur Tatsachen gelten zu lassen, untreu ge- 
worden ist. Mach hat selbst versucht, die Mechanik von diesem groben 
Schönheitsfehler zu befreien. Er meinte, die Trägheitskräfte müßten als 
Wirkungen der gesamten Massen der Welt aufgefaßt werden, und entwarf 
die Skizze einer abgeänderten Dynamik, in der nur relative Größen auf- 
treten. Doch konnte sein Versuch nicht gelingen; einmal entging ihm 
die Bedeutung der Beziehung zwischen Trägheit und Gravitation, die in 
der Proportionalität von Gewicht und Masse zum Ausdruck kommt^ sodann 
fehlte ihm die Relativitätstheorie der optischen und elektromagnetischen 
Erscheinungen, durch die das Vorurteil der absoluten Zeit beseitigt wird. 
Beides ist zur Aufstellung der neuen Mechanik nötig gewesen, beides hat 
Einstein geleistet.

IV. Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 

I. Der Äther. 

Die Mechanik ist historisch und sachlich das Fundament der Physik; 
aber sie ist doch nur ein Teil, sogar ein kleiner Teil der Physik. Wir 
haben bisher nur mechanische Erfahrungen und Theorien zur Lösung des 
Problems von Raum und Zeit herangezogen; »jetzt müssen wir fragen, was 
die anderen Zweige der wissenschaftlichen Forschung darüber lehren. 

Da sind es vor allem die Gebiete der Optik, der Elektrizität und des 
Magnetismus, die in Beziehung zum Raumproblem stehen, und zwar des- 
wegen, weil das Licht und die elektrischen und magnetischen Kräfte den 
leeren Raum durchdringen. Luftleer gepumpte Gefäße sind auch bei 
höchstem Vakuum für Licht vollständig durchlässig; elektrische und magne- 
tische Kräfte wirken durch das Vakuum. Das Licht der Sonne und Sterne 
erreicht uns durch den leeren Weltenraum; die Zusammenhänge zwischen 
den Sonnenflecken und den irdischen Polarlichtern und magnetischen 
Stürmen zeigen ohne jede Theorie, daß auch die elektromagnetischen 
Wirkungen den Weltenraum überbrücken. 

Diese Tatsache, daß gewisse physikalische Vorgänge sich durch den 
Weltenraum fortpflanzen, hat früh zu der Hypothese geführt, daß der Raum 
gar nicht leer, sondern mit einem äußerst feinen, unwägbaren Stoffe, dem 
Äther^ erfüllt sei, der der Träger dieser Erscheinungen ist. Soweit man 
diesen Begriff" des Äthers heute noch gebraucht, versteht man darunter 
nichts anderes als den mit gewissen physikalischen Zuständen oder »Feldern« 
behafteten leeren Raum. Wollten wir uns gleich von vornherein auf eine 
solche abstrakte Begriffsbildung festlegen, so würde uns der größte Teil 
der Probleme unverständlich bleiben, die sich historisch an den Äther 
knüpfen. Dieser galt durchaus als wirklicher Stoff", nicht nur mit physi- 
kalischen Zuständen behaftet, sondern auch fähig, Bewegungen auszu- 
führen. 

Wir wollen nun die Entwicklung der Prinzipien erst der Optik, dann 
der Elektrodynamik darstellen; beides wird als Physik des Äthers zu- 
sammengefaßt. Damit entfernen wir uns zunächst ein wenig von dem 
Raum- und Zeitproblem, um es dann mit neuen Erfahrungen und Gesetzen 
wieder aufzunehmen. 



Emissions- und Undulationstheorie. 6q 



2. Emissions- und Undulationstheorie. 

»Demnach sag' ich, es senden die Oberflächen der Körper 
Dünne Figuren von sich, die Ebenbilder der Dinge. 

es müssen die Bilder 

In unmerklicher Zeit unermeßliche Weiten ereilen. 

. . . Da wir jedoch allein mit dem Auge zu sehen vermögen, 

Kommt es, daß nur von da, wohin sich wendet das Auge, 

Da nur getroffen es wird von Gestalt und Farbe der Dinge. . . .« 

So ZU lesen in des Titus Lucretius Carus Lehrgedicht von der 
Natur der Dinge (4. Buch), jenem poetischen Leitfaden der epikureischen 
Philosophie, der im letzten Jahrhundert vor Christi Geburt geschrieben ist. 

Die zitierten Verse enthalten eine Art Emissionstheorie des Lichtes, 
die von dem Dichter mit reicher Phantasie, zugleich aber mit durchaus 
naturwissenschaftlicher Einstellung durchgeführt wird. Und doch können 
wir diese Lehre ebensowenig wie andere antike Spekulationen über das 
Licht als wissenschaftliche Theorie bezeichnen; es fehlt jeder Versuch 
einer quantitativen Bestimmung der Erscheinungen, des ersten Merkmals 
einer Objektivierung. Bei den Lichterscheinungen ist es wohl auch be- 
sonders schwer, die subjektive Lichtempfindung von dem physikalischen 
Vorgange zu trennen und sie meßbar zu machen. 

Die wissenschaftliche Optik kann man von dem Auftreten des Des- 
cartes an rechnen; seine Dioptrik (1638) enthält die Grundgesetze der 
Lichtfortpflanzung, das Spiegelungs- und das Brechungsgesetz; das erstere 
war schon im Altertum bekannt, das zweite kurz zuvor von Snellius 
(um 16 18) experimentell gefunden worden. Descartes entwickelte eine 
Vorstellung vom Äther als Träger des Lichtes, die ein Vorläufer der Un- 
dulationstheorie ist. Diese findet sich schon angedeutet bei Robert 
Hooke (1667), klar formuliert von Christian Huygens (1678); ihr 
etwas jüngerer großer Zeitgenosse Newton gilt als der Urheber der ent- 
gegengesetzten" Lehrmeinung, der Emissionstheorie. Ehe wir auf den 
Kampf dieser Theorien eingehen, wollen wir ihr Wesen in kurzen Zügen 
erläutern. 

Die Emissionstheorie behauptet, daß von den leuchtenden Körpern 
feine Teilchen ausgeschleudert werden, die nach den Gesetzen der 
Mechanik sich bewegen und, wenn sie das Auge treffen, die Lichtempfin- 
dungen auslösen. 

Die Undulationstheorie setzt die Lichtausbreitung in Analogie mit der 
Bewegung von Wellen auf einer Wasseroberfläche oder mit den Schall- 
wellen in der Luft. Sie muß dazu annehmen, daß ein alle durchsichtigen 
Körper durchdringendes Medium vorhanden ist, das Schwingungen aus- 
führen kann; das ist der Lichtäther. Die einzelnen Teilchen dieser Sub- 
stanz bewegen sich dabei nur pendelnd um ihre Gleichgewichtslagen ; das, 
was als Lichtwelle forteilt, ist der Bewegungszustand der Teilchen, nicht 
diese selbst. Die Zeichnung (Abb. 47) zeigt diesen Vorgang an einer Reihe 
von Punkten, die auf und ab schwingen können; jedes der untereinander

Anblick einer Welle, die von 
Moment zu Moment nach 
rechts vorrückt. 

Es gibt nun einen gewich- 
tigen Grund, der gegen die 
Wellentheorie spricht. Man 
weiß, daß Wellen um Hinder- 
nisse herumlaufen; an jeder 
Wasseroberfläche kann man 
das sehen, aber auch der 
Schall geht »um die Ecke«. 
Dagegen breitet sich ein Licht- 
strahl geradlinig aus ; stellt man 
einen scharfkantigen, undurch- 
sichtigen Körper in seinen 
Weg, so erhält man einen 
scharfbegrenzten Schatten. 
Diese Tatsache hat Newton veranlaßt, die Wellentheorie abzulehnen. 
Er hat sich selbst nicht klar für eine bestimmte Hypothese entschieden und 
nur festgestellt, daß das Licht etwas ist, das sich mit bestimmter Ge- 
schwindigkeit »wie ausgeschleuderte Körperchen« von dem leuchtenden 
Körper fortbewege. Seine Nachfolger aber haben seine Meinung zugunsten 
der Emissionstheorie gedeutet und die Autorität seines Namens hat dieser für 
ein volles Jahrhundert zur Herrschaft verholfen. Dabei war zu seiner Zeit, 
von Grimaldi (posthum publiziert 1665), bereits entdeckt worden, daß 
auch das Licht »um die Ecke« gehen kann; man sieht an scharfen Schatten- 
grenzen eine schwache, streifenförmige Erhellung des Schattenraumes, eine 
Erscheinung, die man Beugimg oder Diffraktion des Lichtes nennt. Diese 
Entdeckung war es besonders, die Huygens zum eifrigen Vorkämpfer der 
Wellentheorie machte; als erstes und wichtigstes Argument für diese sah er 
die Tatsache an, daß zwei Lichtstrahlen einander durchkreuzen, ohne sich 
zu beeinflussen, genau wie zwei Wasserwellenzüge, während Bündel aus- 
geschleuderter Partikel zusammenprallen oder wenigstens sich stören 
müßten. Huygens gelang die Erklärung der Spiegelung und Brechung 
des Lichtes auf Grund der Wellen theorie; dazu diente ihm das jetzt nach 
ihm benannte Prinzip, wonach jeder von einer Lichterregung getroffene 
Punkt wieder als Quelle einer kugelförmigen Lichtwelle anzusehen ist. 
Hierbei ergab sich nun ein prinzipieller Unterschied zwischen der Emis- 
sions- und der Undulationstheorie, der später die endgültige experimentelle 
Entscheidung zugunsten der letzteren herbeiführte. 

Bekanntlich wird ein Lichtstrahl, der aus Luft kommend die ebene 
Grenzfläche eines dichteren Körpers, wie Glas oder Wasser, trifft, so ge- 



Emissions- und Undulationstheorie, 



71 




brochen, daß er in diesem Körper steiler zur Grenzfläche verläuft (Abb. 48). 
Die Emissionstheorie erklärt das durch die Annahme, daß die Licht- 
partikel im Augenblick des Eindringens 
von dem dichteren Medium eine An- 
ziehung erfahren; sie werden also an 
der Grenzfläche senkrecht zu dieser stoß- 
artig beschleunigt und dadurch nach 
innen abgelenkt. Daraus folgt, daß sie 
im dichteren Medium sich schneller be- 
wegen müssen als im dünneren. Die 
Huygenssche Konstruktion nach der 
Wellentheorie beruht genau auf der um- 
gekehrten Annahme (Abb. 49). Die Licht- 
welle erzeugt beim Auftrefi'en auf die 
Grenzfläche in jedem ihrer Punkte Ele- 
mentarwellen; breiten sich diese im Abb. 48. 
zweiten, dichteren Medium langsamer 

aus, so ist die Ebene, die alle diese Kugelwellen berührt und nach Huygens 
die gebrochene Welle darstellt, im richtigen Sinne abgelenkt. 

Huygens deutete auch 
die durch Erasmus Bar- 
tholinus (1669) entdeckte 
Doppelbrechung des Islän- 
dischen Kalkspats auf Grund 
der Wellen theorie durch die 
Annahme, daß das Licht in 
dem Kristall sich mit zwei 
verschiedenen Geschwin- 
digkeiten ausbreiten könne, 
derart, daß die eine Ele- 
mentarwelle eine Kugel, die 
andere ein Sphäroid sei. Er 
entdeckte die merkwürdige 
Erscheinung, daß die bei- 
den aus einem Kalkspatstück austretenden Lichtstrahlen sich gegenüber 
einem zweiten Kalkspatstück 
durchaus anders verhalten als ge- 
wöhnliches Licht; wenn man den 
zweiten Kristall um einen Strahl, 
der aus dem ersten austritt, dreht, 
so entstehen aus ihm je nach der 
Stellung zwei Strahlen von wech- 
selnder Stärke, von denen der 
eine oder der andere auch ganz verschwinden kann (Abb. 50). Newton 
bemerkte (17 17), daß hieraus zu schließen ist, daß ein Lichtstrahl seiner

Symmetrie nach nicht einem Prisma mit kreisrundem, sondern mit quadra- 
tischem Querschnitte entspricht; er deutete diese Tatsache zu Ungunsten 
der Wellentheorie, denn man dachte damals in Analogie zu den Schall- 
wellen immer nur an Verdichtungs- und Verdünnungswellen, bei denen die

Teilchen in der Fortpflanzungsrichtung der Welle, »longitudinal«, pendeln 
(Abb. 51), und es ist klar, daß diese rotatorische Symmetrie um die Rich- 
tung der Fortpflanzung haben müsse. 



3. Die Lichtgeschwindigkeit. 

Unabhängig von dem Streite der beiden Hypothesen über die Natur 
des Lichtes erfolgten die ersten Bestimmungen seiner wichtigsten Eigen- 
schaft, die der Mittelpunkt unserer folgenden Betrachtungen sein wird, 
nämlich der Lichtgeschwindigkeit. Daß diese ungeheuer groß sei, ging 
aus allen Erfahrungen über Lichtausbreitung hervor; Galilei (1607) hatte 
sie mit Hilfe von Laternensignalen zu messen versucht, aber ohne Erfolg, 
denn irdische Entfernungen durcheilt das Licht in außerordentlich kurzen 
Zeiten. Daher gelang die Messung erst durch Benutzung der ungeheuren 
Distanzen zwischen den Himmelskörpern im Weltenraume. 



Die Lichtgeschwindigkeit. 



73 



Olaf Römer bemerkte (1676), daß die regelmäßigen Verfinsterungen 
der Jupitermonde sich verfrühen oder verspäten, je nachdem die Erde 
dem Jupiter näher oder ferner ist (Abb. 52); er deutete diese Erscheinung 
durch den Zeitunterschied, den das Licht zur Durchlaufung der ver- 
schieden langen Wege braucht, und berechnete die Lichtgeschwindigkeit. 
Wir werden diese immer mit c bezeichnen ; ihr genauer Wert, dem Römer 
bereits sehr nahe kam, ist 

(32) c = 300000 km/sec = 3 • io^° cm/sec. 



Eine andere Wirkung der endlichen Lichtgeschwindigkeit entdeckte 
James Bradley (1727), nämlich daß alle Fixsterne eine gemeinsame

jährliche Bewegung auszuführen scheinen, die offenbar ein Gegenbild des 
Umlaufs der Erde um die Sonne ist. Das Zustandekommen dieser Wir- 
kung ist vom Standpunkte der Emissionstheorie sehr einfach zu ver- 
stehen; wir wollen diese Deutung hier mitteilen, müssen aber dabei an- 
merken, daß gerade diese Erscheinung für die Wellentheorie Schwierig- 
keiten verursacht, von denen wir noch viel zu sprechen haben werden. 
Wir wissen (s. III, 7, S. 56), daß eine Bewegung, die in einem Bezug- 
system S geradlinig und gleichförmig ist, es auch in einem andern S' ist, 
wenn dieses eine Translationsbewegung gegen S ausführt; aber Größe und 
Richtung der Geschwindigkeit sind in beiden Systemen anders. Daraus 
folgt, daß ein Strom von Lichtpartikeln, der von einem Fixstern kommend 
die bewegte Erde trifft, aus einer andern Richtung zu kommen scheint. 
Wir wollen diese Ablenkung oder Aberration für den Fall, daß das Licht 
senkrecht zur Bewegung der Erde auftrifft, besonders betrachten (Abb. 53). 
Wenn eine Lichtpartikel das Objektiv eines Fernrohrs trifft, möge dieses 
in der Stellung i sein; während nun das Licht die Länge / des Fern- 
rohrs durcheilt, verschiebt sich die Erde mit dem Fernrohr in die 



74 Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 



Stellung 2 um ein Stück d\ der Strahl trifft also nur dann die Mitte des 
Okulars, wenn er nicht aus der Richtung der Fernrohrachse, sondern aus 
einer etwas gegen die Erdbewegung zurückliegenden Richtung kommt. 
Die Visierrichtung zeigt daher nicht auf den wahren Ort des Sternes, 
sondern auf einen nach vorn verschobenen Ort des Himmels. Der Ab- 
lenkungswinkel ist durch das Verhältnis d\ l bestimmt und ofienbar von 
der Fernrohrlänge / unabhängig ; denn vergrößert man diese, so vergrößert 
sich auch die Zeit, die das Licht zum Durchlaufen braucht, und damit 
auch die Verschiebung d der Erde im selben Verhältnisse. Die beiden, 
in gleichen Zeiten vom Licht und von der Erde durchlaufenen Wege / 
und d müssen sich wie die entsprechenden Geschwindigkeiten ver- 
halten : 

d V 

T ^ ~7 ' 

Dieses Verhältnis, auch Aberrationskonstmite genannt, wollen wir in 
Zukunft immer mit ß bezeichnen: 

(33) ß^~- 

Es hat einen sehr kleinen Zahlenwert, denn die Geschwindigkeit der 
Erde in ihrer Bahn um die Sonne beträgt ungefähr z/ = 30 km/sec, 
während, wie wir schon sagten, die Lichtgeschwindigkeit ^= 300000 km/sec 
ist; daher ist />* von der Größenordnung i : 10 000. 

Die scheinbaren Örter aller Fixsterne hegen also immer etwas in der 
Richtung der momentanen Erdbewegung verschoben und beschreiben 
daher während des jährlichen Umlaufs der Erde um die Sonne eine kleine 
elliptische Figur. Durch Ausmessen dieser kann man das Verhältnis ß 
finden, und da die Geschwindigkeit v der Erde in ihrer Bahn aus astrono- 
mischen Daten bekannt ist, läßt sich daraus die Lichtgeschwindigkeit c 
bestimmen. Das Resultat ist in guter Übereinstimmung mit der Römer- 
schen Messung. 

Wir greifen jetzt der geschichtlichen Entwicklung vor und berichten 
von den irdischen Messungen der Lichtgeschwindigkeit. Hierzu gehört 
grundsätzlich nichts als ein technisches Verfahren, die außerordentlich 
kurzen Zeiten, die das Licht zum Durchlaufen irdischer Entfernungen von 
wenigen Kilometern oder gar Metern braucht, sicher zu messen. Nach 
zwei verschiedenen Methoden haben Fizeau (1849) "^^ Foucault 
(1865) diese Messungen ausgeführt und den mit astronomischen Ver- 
fahren gefundenen Zahlenwert von c bestätigt. Die Einzelheiten der Ver- 
fahren brauchen hier nicht erörtert zu werden, zumal sie in jedem 
elementaren Lehrbuche der Physik zu finden sind : nur auf eines ist auf- 
merksam zu machen: Bei beiden Verfahren wird der Lichtstrahl von der 
Quelle Q nach einem entfernten Spiegel S geworfen, dort wird er 
reflektiert und kehrt zum Ausgangspunkt zurück (Abb. 54). Er durchläuft 
also denselben Weg zweimal, und gemessen wird darum nur die mittlere 



Grundbegriffe der Wellenlehre. Interferenz. 



75 



Geschwindigkeit auf dem Hin- und Rückwege. Das hat eine für unsere 
folgenden Überlegungen wichtige Konsequenz: Gesetzt, die Geschwindig- 
keit des Lichtes sei in beiden 

Richtungen nicht gleich, darum, ^^ 

weil die Erde sich selbst bewegt 
— wir gehen darauf später (IV, 9, 
S. 102) näher ein — , so wird sich 
dieser Einfluß beim Hin- und 
Hergange ganz oder fast ganz 
wegheben. 




Abb. 54. 



Daher braucht man 
mit Rücksicht auf die Klein- 
heit der Geschwindigkeit der Erde gegen die des Lichtes bei diesen 
Messungen auf die Erdbewegung praktisch keine Rücksicht zu nehmen. 
Die Messungen der Lichtgeschwindigkeit sind später mit größeren 
Hilfsmitteln wiederholt worden und haben eine beträchtliche Genauigkeit 
erreicht; sie können heute in einem Zimmer von mäßiger Länge aus- 
geführt werden. Das Resultat ist der oben angegebene Wert (32). Mit 
der Methode von Foucault konnte auch die Geschwindigkeit des Lichtes 
in Wasser gemessen werden; sie fand sich kleiner als die in Luft. Damit 
wurde eine der wichtigsten Streitfragen zwischen Emissions- und Undu- 
lationstheorie endgültig zugunsten der letzteren entschieden, allerdings 
zu einer Zeit, wo der Sieg der Wellenlehre ohnedies schon lange ge- 
sichert war. 



4. Grundbegriffe der W^ellenlehre. Interferenz. 

Newtons größte optische Leistung ist die Zerlegung des weißen Lichtes 
in seine farbigen Bestandteile mit Hilfe eines Prismas und die exakte 
Untersuchung des Spektrums, die ihn zu der Überzeugung führte, daß 
die einzelnen Spektralfarben die unzerlegbaren Bestandteile des Lichtes 
seien. Er ist der Begründer der Farbenlehre, deren physikalischer Gehalt 
noch heute — trotz Goethes Angriffen — vollständig in Geltung ist. 
Die Wucht der Entdeckungen Newtons lähmte den freien Blick der 
folgenden Generationen. Seine Ablehnung der Wellentheorie versperrte 
dieser fast 100 Jahre den Weg. Doch fand sie immer vereinzelte An- 
hänger, so im 18. Jahrhundert vor allem in dem großen Mathematiker 
Leonhard Euler. 

Die Wiederbelebung der Wellentheorie ist den Arbeiten von Thomas 
Young (1802) zu danken, der das Prinzip der Interferenz zur Erklärung 
der farbigen Ringe und Streifen heranzog, die schon Newton an dünnen 
Schichten durchsichtiger Substanzen beobachtet hatte. Wir wollen uns 
an dieser Stelle mit dem Vorgange der Interferenz etwas näher beschäf- 
tigen, weil dieser bei allen feineren optischen Messungen, insbesondere 
bei den Untersuchungen, die die Grundlage der Relativitätstheorie bilden, 
eine entscheidende Rolle spielt. 



76 



Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 



Wir haben oben das Wesen der Welle erklärt; es besteht darin, daß 
die einzelnen Teilchen eines Körpers um ihre Gleichgewichtslagen perio- 
dische Schwingungen ausführen, wobei die augenblickliche Lage oder 
Bewegungsphase benachbarter Teilchen verschieden ist und mit konstanter 
Geschwindigkeit vorwärts rückt. Die Zeit, die ein bestimmtes Teilchen 
zu einer Hin- und Herschwingung gebraucht^ heißt Schwingungsdauer 
oder Periode und wird mit 7 bezeichnet; die Anzahl der Schwingutigen 
in einer Sekunde oder Frequenz bezeichnen wir mit v. Da die Dauer 
einer Schwingung multipliziert mit ihrer Anzahl pro Sekunde gerade eine 
volle Sekunde geben muß, so muß vT^=^\ sein, also 



(34) 



r = -TZ, oder T ^^ — 
T V 




Abb. 55. 



Anstatt Schwingungszahl sagt 
man oft auch »Farbe«, weil eine 
Lichtwelle von bestimmter Schwin- 
gungszahl eine bestimmte Farben- 
empfindung im Auge auslöst. Auf 
die verwickelte Frage, wie die 
große Mannigfaltigkeit der psycho- 
logischen Farbeneindrücke durch 
das Zusammenwirken einfacher 
periodischer Schwingungen oder 
»physikalischer Farben« zustande 
kommt, gehen wir nicht ein. Die 
Wellen, die von einer kleinen 
Lichtquelle ausgehen, haben die 
Form von Kugeln ; das bedeutet, 
alle Teilchen auf einer Kugel um 
die Quelle befinden sich stets in gleichem Schwingungszustande oder in 
gleicher »Phase« (Abb. 55). Durch Brechung oder andere Beeinflussung 

kann ein Teil einer solchen 
Kugelwelle deformiert werden, 
so daß die Flächen gleicher 
Phase oder Wellenflächen ir- 
gendeine andere Form haben. 
Die einfachste Wellenfläche ist 
ofienbar die Ebene, und es 
ist klar, daß ein hinreichend 
kleines Stück einer beliebigen 
Abb. 56. Wellenfläche, auch einer Kugel- 

welle, immer näherungsweise 
als eben angesehen werden kann. Wir betrachten daher hauptsächlich 
die Fortpflanzung ebener Wellen (Abb. 56). Die auf den Wellenebenen 
senkrechte Richtung, die Wellennormale, ist zugleich die Fortpflanzungs- 



Grundbegriffe der Wellenlehre. Interferenz. nn 



richtung; es genügt offenbar, den Schwingungszustand längs einer dieser 
Richtung parallelen Geraden zu betrachten. 

Ob die Schwingung des einzelnen Teilchens parallel oder senkrecht 
zur Fortpflanzungsrichtung, longitudinal oder transversal, erfolgt, lassen 
wir hier noch ganz offen. In den Figuren zeichnen wir immer Wellen- 
linien und nennen entsprechend die Stellen stärkster Ausschläge . nach 
oben und unten Wellenberge und Wellentäler. 

Der Abstand von einem Wellenberge zum nächsten heißt Wellenlänge 
und wird mit k bezeichnet. Genau ebenso groß ist offenbar der Ab- 
stand zweier aufeinander folgender Wellentäler oder irgend zweier benach- 
barter Ebenen gleicher Phase. 

Während einer Hin- und Herschwingung eines bestimmten Teilchens, 
deren Dauer T ist, rückt die ganze Welle gerade um eine Wellenlänge A 
vorwärts (Abb. 47, S. 70). Da nun für jede Bewegung die Geschwindigkeit 
gleich dem Verhältnis des zurückgelegten Weges zu der dazu gebrauchten 
Zeit ist, so ist die Wellengeschwindigkeit c gleich dem Verhältnis von 
Wellenlänge zur Schwingungsdauer: 

(35) ^ ~ Y °^^^ ^ "^ ^^' 

Wenn eine Welle von einem Medium ins andere, etwa von Luft in Glas, 
tritt, so wird natürlich der zeitliche Rhythmus der Schwingungen durch 
die Grenze hindurch übertragen; es bleibt also T (oder v) dasselbe. Da- 
gegen ändert sich die Geschwindigkeit c und daher wegen der Formel (35) 
auch die Wellenlänge X. Alle Methoden, 1 zu messen, können also zum 
Vergleich der Lichtgeschwindigkeiten in verschiedenen Substanzen oder unter 
verschiedenen Umständen dienen. Hiervon werden wir später viel Ge-

Wir können jetzt das Wesen der Interferenzerscheinungen verstehen, 
deren Entdeckung der Wellentheorie zum Siege verholfen hat. Die Inter- 
ferenz kann man mit paradox klingenden Worten so beschreiben: Licht 
zu Licht gefügt gibt nicht notwendig verstärktes Licht, sondern kann sich 
auch auslöschen. 

Der Grund hierfür ist der, daß nach der Wellentheorie das Licht 
kein Strom materieller Partikeln, sondern ein Bewegungszustand ist; zwei 
aufeinander treffende Bewegungsimpulse können aber die Bewegung ver- 
nichten, gerade so wie zwei Menschen, die Entgegengesetzes wollen, sich 
hindern und nichts zustande bringen. Wir denken uns zwei Wellenzüge, 
die einander durchkreuzen. Man kann diesen Vorgang schön beobachten, 
wenn man von Bergeshöhe auf einen See blickt, auf dem die von zwei 
Schiffen erregten Wellen sich begegnen (Abb. 57). Diese beiden Wellen- 
systeme dringen durcheinander hindurch, ohne sich zu stören; in dem 
Gebiete, wo sie beide zugleich existieren, entsteht eine komplizierte Be- 
wegung, sobald aber die eine Welle durch die andere hindurchgegangen 
ist, läuft sie weiter, als wäre ihr nichts passiert. Faßt man die Bewegung

eines schwingenden Teilchens ins Auge, so erfährt dieses von beiden 
Wellen unabhängige Bewegungsantriebe; sein Ausschlag ist daher in jedem 
Augenblicke einfach die Summe der Ausschläge, die es unter dem Ein- 
fluß der einzelnen Wellen haben würde. Man sagt, zwei Wellenbe- 
wegungen superponieren sich ungestört. Daraus folgt, daß dort, wo bei der 





Abb. 58. 




Abb. 57. 



Abb. 59. 



Begegnung zweier gleicher Wellen Wellenberg auf Wellenberg und Wellental 
auf Wellental trifft, eine Verdoppelung der Erhebungen und Vertiefungen 
eintritt (Abb. 58); wo aber Wellenberg auf Wellental trifft, zerstören sich 
die Impulse und es entsteht überhaupt kein Ausschlag (Abb. 59). 

Will man Lichtinterferenzen beobachten, so darf man nicht einfach 
zwei Lichtquellen nehmen und die von ihnen ausgehenden Wellenzüge 
sich durchdringen lassen; dabei entsteht keine beobachtbare Interferenz- 
erscheinung, weil die wirklichen Lichtwellen keine absolut regelmäßigen 
Wellen sind. Vielmehr wechselt der Schwingungszustand nach einer Reihe 
regelmäßiger Schwingungen plötzHch in zufälliger Weise, entsprechend 
den zufälligen Vorgängen bei der Lichtaussendung in der Lichtquelle; diese 
regellosen Wechsel bewirken ein entsprechendes Schwanken der Interferenz- 
erscheinungen, das viel zu schnell erfolgt, als daß das Auge ihm folgen 
könnte, und so sieht dieses nur gleichmäßiges Licht. 

Man muß, um beobachtbare Interferenzen zu erhalten, einen Licht- 
strahl auf künstlichem Wege, durch Spiegelung und Brechung, in zwei 
Strahlen zerlegen und diese nachher wieder zur Begegnung bringen; dann 
erfolgen die Unregelmäßigkeiten der Schwingungen in beiden Strahlen 
genau im gleichen zeitlichen Rhythmus, und daraus folgt, daß die Inter- 
ferenzerscheinungen räumlich nicht schwanken, sondern fest stehen; wo 
die Wellen in einem Momente sich verstärken oder auslöschen, tun sie 
es zu jeder Zeit. Bringt man das Auge, bewaffnet mit Lupe oder Fern- 
rohr, an eine solche Stelle, so sieht man bei Benutzung von einfarbigem 
Lichte, wie es etwa von einer mit Kochsalz gelb gefärbten Bunsenflamme 
ausgeht, helle und dunkle Flecke, Streifen oder Ringe. Bei gewöhnlichem 
Lichte, das aus vielen Farben zusammengesetzt ist, fallen die den ver- 
schiedenen Wellenlängen entsprechenden Interferenzflecke nicht genau auf-

einander; an einer Steile ist vielleicht Rot verstärkt, Blau ausgelöscht, an 
anderen Stellen ist es anders, und so entstehen Flecken und Streifen nait 
wunderbaren Farbenerscheinungen. Doch würde es uns vom Wege ab- 
führen, diese interessanten Phänomene weiter zu verfolgen. 

Die einfachsten Anordnungen zur Herstellung von Interferenzen hat 
Fresnel {1822) angegeben, ein Forscher, dessen Arbeiten die Grundlage für 
die Theorie des Lichtes geliefert haben, wie sie bis in unsere Tage unange- 
fochten gegolten hat. Wir werden seinem Namen noch öfters begegnen. 
Jene Zeit der ersten Dezennien des 19. Jahrhunderts muß in mancher 
Hinsicht unserer Epoche ähnlich gewesen sein. Wie heute durch die 
Entdeckung der Radioaktivität und der damit verwandten Strahlungsvor- 
gänge, durch die Aufstellung der Relativitätstheorie und der Quantenlehre 
eine ungeheure Vertiefung und Verbreiterung unserer Naturerkenntnis im 
Werden ist, die dem außen Stehenden als vollständiger Umsturz aller Be- 
griffe erscheint, so wuchsen vor 100 Jahren die Tausende von einzelnen 
Beobachtungen, theoretischen Versuchen, physischen oder metaphysischen 
Spekulationen zum ersten Male zu geschlossenen, einheitlichen Vorstel- 
lungen und Theorien zusammen, deren Anwendung sogleich eine ungeahnte 
Fülle neuer Beobachtungen und Experimente anregte. Damals waren La- 
granges analytische ^Mechanik, Laplaces Mechanik des Himmels ent- 
standen, jene beiden Werke, die Newtons Ideen zum Abschlüsse brachten; 
daraus entwickelte sich einerseits in den Händen von Nävi er, Poisson, 
Cauchy, Green die Mechanik der deformierbaren Körper, die Theorie der 
Flüssigkeiten und elastischen Substanzen, andererseits 
durch die Arbeiten von Young, Fresnel, Arago, 
Malus, Brewster die Theorie des Lichtes. Zugleich 
begann die Ära der elektromagnetischen Entdeckungen, 
von der später die Rede sein wird. Damals war die 
physikahsche Forschung fast ausschließlich in den 
Händen der Franzosen, Engländer, Italiener. Heute 
sind alle Kulturnationen an dem Werke beteiligt, und 
die Urheber der großen, umstürzenden Theorien der S^ 
Relativität und der Quanten, Einstein und Planck, 
sind Deutsche. 

Fresnel läßt einen Lichtstrahl an zwei schwach 
gegeneinander geneigten Spiegeln S^ und S^ (Abb. 60) 
reflektieren; die beiden reflektierten Strahlen liefern 
da, wo sie sich begegnen, Interferenzstreifen, die man 
mit einer Lupe sehen kann. Ähnliche Vorrichtungen 
sind in großer Anzahl angegeben worden. Wir wollen 
hier nur auf ein Anwendungsgebiet eingehen, das für unsere Absicht von 
Wichtigkeit ist, nämlich experimentelle Methoden, um winzige Änderungen 
der Lichtgeschwindigkeit zu messen. Solche Apparate heißen Interfero- 
meter\ sie beruhen darauf, daß mit der Lichtgeschwindigkeit die Wellen- 
länge sich ändert und dadurch die Interferenzen verschoben werden. Ein

Apparat dieser Art ist das Interferometer von Michelson , dem Physiker 
der Universität Chicago. Es besteht in der Hauptsache (Abb. 6i) aus 
einer Glasplatte P^ die halb durchlässig versilbert ist, so daß sie die Hälfte 

des von der Lichtquelle Q kommen- 
den Strahls durchläßt, die andere 
Hälfte reflektiert; diese beiden Teil- 
strahlen laufen nach zwei Spiegeln S^ 
und »S2, werden dort zurückgeworfen 
und treffen wieder die halbdurch- 
lässige Glasplatte P^ die sie nochmals 
teilt und je einen halben Strahl in 
das Beobachtungsfernrohr F schickt. 
Sind die beiden Weglängen PS^ und 
PS^ genau gleich, so kommen die 
beiden Teilstrahlen im Fernrohr mit 
derselben Schwingungsphase an und 
setzen sich wieder zum ursprüngHchen 
Lichte zusammen ; verlängert man aber 
durch Verschieben des Spiegels S^ den 
Weg des ersten Teilstrahls, so fallen 
bei der Vereinigung der Strahlen in F die Wellenzüge nicht mehr mit 
Berg auf Berg, Tal auf Tal aufeinander, sondern sind gegeneinander ver- 
schoben und schwächen sich mehr oder weniger. Wenn man den Spiegel S^ 
langsam bewegt, sieht man also im Fernrohr F abwechselnd Helligkeiten 
und Dunkelheiten; der Abstand der Stellungen von S^ für zwei aufeinan- 
der folgende Dunkelheiten ist genau gleich der Wellenlänge des Lichtes. 
Michelson hat auf diese Weise Messungen der Wellenlänge gemacht, die 
an Genauigkeit fast alle anderen physikalischen Messungen übertreffen. 
Das gelingt dadurch, daß man die Wechsel der Helligkeiten und Dunkel- 
heiten bei einer beträchtlichen Verschiebung des Spiegels S^ zählt, welche 
viele tausend Wellenlängen umfaßt; der Beobachtungsfehler einer einzelnen 
Wellenlänge wird dann um ebensoviel tausendmal kleiner. 

Es ist hier der Ort, einige Zahlenangaben zu machen ; man findet auf 

dem geschilderten Wege, daß die Wellenlänge des gelben Lichtes, das 

von einer mit Kochsalz (Natriumchlorid) gelb gefärbten Bunsenflamme 

ausgeht und dessen Quelle die Natriumatome sind, im Vakuum etwa 

Q mm = 6 • io~"^cm ist; alles sichtbare Licht liegt in dem kleinen 




Wellenlängenbereiche von etwa 4 • io~^ (Violett) bis 8 • 10:;^ cm (Rot). 
Dieser umfaßt also in der Sprache der Akustik eine Oktave, d. h. den 
Bereich von einer Welle bis zur doppelt so langen. Aus der Formel (35) 
folgt dann für die Schwingungszahl des gelben Natriumlichtes der unge- 



heure Betrag von v =

Schwingungen pro sec. Die raschesten Schallschwingungen, die noch 
hörbar sind, schwingen nur etwa 50 000 mal in der Sekunde. 



Polarisation und Transversalität der Lichtwellen. 8l 

Auf der bei interferometrischen Messungen angewandten Multiplikation 
der einzelnen Wellenlänge beruht die erstaunliche Genauigkeit der opti- 
schen Meßmethoden. Man kann damit z. B. feststellen, daß die Licht- 
geschwindigkeit in einem Gase bei einer winzigen Druck- oder Tempe- 
raturänderung (etwa bei Berühren des Apparates mit der Hand) ebenfalls 
variiert; dazu bringt man das Gas in einem Rohre zwischen die Glas- 
platte P und den Spiegel S^^ dann sieht man schon bei den kleinsten 
Druckerhöhungen die Interferenzen sich ändern, Helligkeiten mit Dunkel- 
heiten sich ablösen. 

Übrigens müssen wir noch anmerken, daß man in dem Interferometer 
gewöhnlich nicht einfach ein helles oder dunkles Gesichtsfeld sieht, son- 
dern ein System heller und dunkler Ringe. Das kommt daher, daß die 
beiden Strahlen nicht genau parallel, die Wellen nicht genau eben sind; 
die einzelnen Teile der beiden Strahlen haben also etwas verschieden 
lange Wege zurückzulegen. Wir wollen aber auf die geometrischen Einzel- 
heiten nicht eingehen, sondern erwähnen diesen Umstand nur, weil man 
von Interferenzstreifen oder -fransen zu sprechen pflegt. 

Wir werden dem Michelsonschen Interferometer wieder begegnen, 
wenn es sich um die Entscheidung der Frage handeln wird, ob die Erd- 
bewegung die Lichtgeschwindigkeit beeinflußt. 

5. Polarisation und Transversalität der Lichtwellen. 

Obwohl die Interferenzerscheinungen kaum eine andere Deutung als 
die der Wellentheorie zulassen, so standen deren allgemeiner Anerkennung 
noch zwei Schwierigkeiten im Wege, die, wie wir oben sahen, von Newton 
als entscheidend angesehen wurden: Erstens die in der Hauptsache (d. h. 
bis auf die geringfügigen Beugungserscheinungen) geradlinige Ausbreitung 
des Lichtes, zweitens die Erklärung der Polarisationserscheinungen. Der 
erste Punkt erledigte sich bei der genaueren Ausarbeitung der Wellen- 
lehre von selbst; es zeigte sich nämlich, daß Wellen zwar »um die Ecke« 
gehen, aber nur in Bereichen, die von der Größenordnung der Wellen- 
länge sind. Da diese sehr klein ist, so entsteht für die rohe Betrach- 
tung der Anschein scharfer Schatten und geradlinig begrenzter Strahlen; 
erst feinere Beobachtung kann die Interferenzfransen des gebeugten Lichtes 
längs der Schattengrenze bemerken. Um die Ausgestaltung der Beugungs- 
theorie haben sich Fresnel, später Kirchhoff (1882) und in neuerer 
Zeit Sommerfeld (1895) große Verdienste erworben; sie haben die feinen 
Beugungserscheinungen rechnerisch abgeleitet und die Grenzen festgelegt, 
innerhalb deren man mit dem Begriffe des Lichtstrahls operieren darf. 

Die zweite Schwierigkeit betraf die Erscheinungen der Polarisation 
des Lichtes. 

Wenn man damals von Wellen sprach, so dachte man immer an 
longitudinale Schwingungen, wie sie beim Schall bekannt waren; eine 
Schallwelle besteht ja in rhythmischen Verdichtungen und Verdünnungen,

wobei das einzelne Luftteilchen in der Richtung der Fortpflanzung der 
Welle hin und her pendelt. Transversale Schwingungen kannte man 
allerdings auch, z. B. die Oberflächenwellen auf einem Wasserspiegel, oder 
die Schwingungen einer gespannten Saite, wobei die Teilchen senkrecht 
zur Fortpflanzungsrichtung der Welle pendeln. Aber hierbei handelt es 
sich nicht um Wellen, die im Innern einer Substanz fortschreiten, sondern 
teils um Erscheinungen an der Oberfläche (Wasserwellen), teils um Be- 
wegungen des ganzen Gebildes (Saitenschwingungen). Beobachtungen oder 
Theorien über die Fortpflanzung von Wellen in elastischen, festen Körpern 
waren damals noch nicht vorhanden; dies erklärt die uns merkwürdig 
erscheinende Tatsache, daß es so lange gedauert hat, bis die optischen 
Wellen als transversale Schwingungen erkannt wurden. Ja, es trat der sonder- 
bare Fall ein, daß der Anstoß zur Entwicklung der Mechanik der grobsinn- 
lichen, elastischen Festkörper durch Erfahrungen und Begriff'sbildungen 
über die Dynamik des unwägbaren, unfaßbaren Äthers gegeben wurde. 

Wir haben oben (S. 71) erklärt, worin das Wesen der Polarisation be- 
steht; die beiden, aus einem doppelt brechenden Kalkspatstück austreten- 
den Strahlen verhalten sich beim Durchgang durch einen zweiten solchen 
Kristall nicht wie gewöhnliches Licht, sie zerfallen nicht wieder in je zwei 
gleich starke Strahlen, sondern in un- 
gleiche, von denen der eine unter 
Umständen ganz verschwinden kann. 





Abb. 62. 



Abb. 63. 



Bei gewöhnlichem, »natürlichem« Licht sind die verschiedenen Richtungen 
innerhalb einer Wellenebene gleichwertig (Abb. 62); bei polarisiertem Licht 
ist das offenbar nicht mehr der Fall. Malus entdeckte (1808), daß die 
Polarisation nicht eine Eigentümlichkeit des durch doppelt brechende Kri- 
stalle gegangenen Lichtes ist, sondern auch durch einfache Spiegelung 
erzeugt werden kann; er zeigte, daß Licht, welches von einem Spiegel 
unter einem bestimmten Winkel reflektiert worden ist, von einem zweiten 
Spiegel verschieden stark reflektiert wird, wenn man diesen um den auf- 
treffenden Strahl herumdreht (Abb. d^)- Man nennt die auf der Spiegel- 
fläche senkrechte Ebene, die den einfallenden und reflektierten Strahl 
enthält, die Einfallsebene; man sagt dann, der reflektierte Strahl sei in 



Polarisation und Transversalität der Lichtwellen. 



83 



der Einfallsebene polarisiert, womit man nichts anderes meint, als daß er 
sich gegenüber einer zweiten Spiegelung verschieden verhält, je nachdem 
die zweite Einfallsebene zur ersten liegt. Stehen beide aufeinander senk- 
recht, so findet überhaupt keine Reflexion am zweiten Spiegel statt. 

Die beiden aus einem Kalkspatstück austretenden Strahlen sind senk- 
recht zueinander polarisiert; läßt man sie beide unter geeignetem Winkel 
auf einen Spiegel fallen, so wird der eine gerade bei derjenigen Stellung 
des Spiegels ausgelöscht, wo der andere in vollem Betrage reflektiert wird. 

Den entscheidenden Versuch machten Fresnel und Arago (1816), 
indem sie zwei solche, senkrecht aufeinander polarisierte Strahlen zur 
Interferenz zu bringen versuchten. Es gelang ihnen nicht, Interferenzen 
zu erzeugen, und Fresnel wie auch Young zogen nun die Konsequenz 
(181 7), daß die Lichtschwingungen transversal sein müßten. 

Dadurch wird in der Tat das eigentümliche Verhalten polarisierten 
Lichtes sogleich verständlich. Die Schwingungen eines Ätherteilchens 
finden nicht in der Fortpflanzungsrichtung, sondern senkrecht dazu, also 
in der Wellenebene statt (Abb. 62). Jede Bewegung eines Punktes in einer 
Ebene kann man aber auffassen als zusammengesetzt aus zwei Bewe- 
gungen in zwei zueinander senkrechten Richtungen; wir haben ja bei der 
Besprechung der Kinematik eines Punktes gesehen, daß die Bewegung des- 
selben durch Angabe der mit der Zeit sich ändernden rechtwinkligen 
Koordinaten eindeutig bestimmt ist. Ein doppelt brechender Kristall 
hat nun offenbar die Eigenschaft, daß sich in ihm die Schwingungen des 
Lichts in zwei zueinander senkrechten Richtungen verschieden schnell 
fortpflanzen; sie werden daher — nach dem Huygensschen Prinzipe — 
beim Eindringen in den Kristall verschieden stark abgelenkt oder ge- 
brochen und daher räumlich getrennt. Jeder der beiden austretenden 





Abb. 64. 



Abb. 65. 



Strahlen besteht dann nur aus Schwingungen, die in je einer bestimmten, 
durch die Strahlrichtung gehenden Ebene stattfinden, und die zu den 
beiden Strahlen gehörigen Ebenen stehen aufeinander senkrecht (Abb. 64); 
zwei solche Schwingungen können sich offenbar nicht beeinflussen, sie 
können nicht miteinander interferieren. Tritt nun ein polarisierter Strahl 
in einen zweiten Kristall, so wird er nur dann ohne Schwächung durch- 
gelassen, wenn seine Schwingungsrichtung gerade die richtige Lage zu 

6* 



84. Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 

dem Kristall hat, in der sich eben diese Schwingungsrichtung fortpflanzen 
kann; in allen anderen Stellungen wird der Strahl geschwächt, in der 
senkrechten oder gekreuzten Stellung überhaupt nicht durchgelassen. 

Ganz ähnlich verhält es sich bei der Spiegelung; geschieht diese unter 
dem geeigneten Winkel, so wird von den beiden Schwingungen parallel 
und senkrecht zur Einfallsebene nur die eine reflektiert, die andere dringt 
in den Spiegel ein und wird darin verschluckt (Abb. 65). Ob die reflek- 
tierte Schwingung diejenige ist, die in der Einfallsebene, oder die, die 
senkrecht zu ihr pendelt, das läßt sich natürlich nicht feststellen. (In der 
Abb. 65 ist letzteres angenommen.) Aber diese Frage nach der Lage der 
Schwingung zur Einfallsebene oder Polarisationsrichtung hat Anlaß zu um- 
fangreichen Untersuchungen, Theorien und Diskussionen gegeben, wie wir 
sogleich sehen werden. 

6. Der Äther als elastischer Festkörper. 

Nachdem so die Transversalität der Lichtwellen erkannt und durch 
zahlreiche Versuche erwiesen war, erstand vor Fresnels geistigem Auge 
das Bild einer zukünftigen dynamischen Lichttheorie, die die optischen Er- 
scheinungen nach dem Vorbilde der Mechanik aus den Eigenschaften des 
Äthers und der in ihm wirkenden Kräfte abzuleiten hätte. Der Äther 
mußte also eine Art elastischer, fester Körper sein; denn nur in diesen 
können mechanische Transversalwellen vorkommen. Aber zu Fresnels 
Zeit war die mathematische Theorie der Elastizität fester Körper noch 
nicht entwickelt; auch mochte wohl Fresnel glauben, daß man die Analogie 
des Äthers mit materiellen Substanzen nicht von vornherein zu weit treiben 
dürfe. Jedenfalls zog er es vor, die Gesetze der Lichtausbreitung empirisch 
zu erforschen und mit der Vorstellung der Transversalwellen zu deuten. 
Vor allem mußte von den optischen Vorgängen in Kristallen Aufklärung 
über das Verhalten des Lichtäthers erwartet werden. Fresnels Arbeiten 
auf diesem Gebiete gehören zu den schönsten Leistungen physikalischer 
Methodik, sowohl in experimenteller als auch in theoretischer Richtung; 
aber wir dürfen uns hier nicht in Einzelheiten verlieren und müssen immer 
unser Problem im Auge behalten: Wie ist der Lichtäther beschafien? 

Fresnels Ergebnisse schienen die Analogie der Lichtwellen mit elastischen 
Wellen zu bestätigen; dadurch erfuhr die schon von Nävi er (182 1) und 
Cauchy (1822) begonnene systematische Bearbeitung der Elastizitäts- 
theorie, der auch Poisson (1828) seine Kraft widmete, eine starke An- 
regung. Cauchy wandte nun auch sogleich die soeben gewonnenen Ge- 
setze der elastischen Wellen auf die Optik an (1829). Wir wollen von dem 
Gedankeninhalt dieser Äthertheorie eine Vorstellung zu geben versuchen. 

Die Schwierigkeit dabei ist, daß das adäquate Mittel zur Beschreibung 
von Veränderungen in kontinuierlichen, deformierbaren Körpern die Methode 
der Differentialgleichungen ist; da wir diese nicht als bekannt voraussetzen 
wollen, so bleibt nichts übrig, als sie an einem einfachen Beispiele zu 
umschreiben und am Schlüsse hinzuzufügen: So ähnlich, nur etwas kom- 



Der Äther als elastischer Festkörper. 85 



plizierter, verhält es sich im allgemeinen Falle. Der mathematisch nicht 
geschulte Leser kann dann vielleicht zu einem rohen Begriff von der Sache 
kommen; was er aber schwerlich gewinnen wird, ist eine Anschauung von 
der Kraft und Leistungsfähigkeit der physikalischen Bilder und der ihnen 
angepaßten mathematischen Methoden. Wir sind uns also der Unmöglich- 
keit bewußt, den Nicht-Mathematiker völlig zu befriedigen, aber wir können 
einen Versuch zur Erläuterung der Mechanik der Kontinua nicht unterlassen, 
weil alle folgenden Theorien, nicht nur die des elastischen Äthers, sondern 
auch die Elektrodynamik in allen ihren Wandlungen und vor allem die 
Einsteinsche Gravitationstheorie auf diesen Begriffsbildungen aufgebaut sind. 
Eine sehr dünne, gespannte Saite ist gewissermaßen ein eindimensio- 
nales, elastisches Gebilde; an diesem wollen wir die Begriffe der Elasti- 
zitätstheorie entwickeln. Um an die gewöhnliche Mechanik, die nur 
einzelne, starre Körper kennt, anknüpfen zu können, denken wir uns 
die Saite nicht kontinuierlich, sondern gewissermaßen atomistisch kon- 
stituiert. Sie bestehe aus einer Reihe von gleichen, kleinen Körperchen, 
die auf einer geraden Linie nebeneinander in gleichen Abständen ange- 
ordnet sind (Abb. 66). Die Teilchen sollen träge Masse haben und jedes 
soll auf seine beiden Nachbarn Kräfte ausüben; diese sollen so beschaffen 
sein, daß sie sich sowohl einer Vergrößerung als einer Verkleinerung des 
Abstandes widersetzen. Will man 

ein anschauliches Bild für solche ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 

G — e — e — e — e — e — e — e — o 

Kräfte haben, so denke man an 

kleine Spiralfedern, die zwischen den ^^^* ^^• 

Körperchen angebracht sind; diese 

widerstreben sowohl einer Zusammendrückung wie einer Dehnung. Aber 

ein solches Bild darf man nicht wörtlich nehmen ; Kräfte der geschilderten 

Art sind eben das Urphänomen der Elastizität. 

Wenn jetzt das erste Teilchen in der Längs- oder der Querrichtung 
ein wenig verschoben wird, so wirkt es sogleich auf das zweite ein; dieses 
aber gibt die Wirkung auf das nächste weiter, usw. Die Störung des 
Gleichgewichts des ersten Teilchens läuft also durch die ganze Reihe hin- 
durch, wie eine kurze Welle, und erreicht schließlich auch das letzte 
Teilchen. Dieser Vorgang geht aber nicht unendlich schnell, sondern bei 
jedem Teilchen tritt ein kleiner Zeitverlust ein, weil es wegen seiner Träg- 
heit dem Anstoß nicht sogleich folgt ; denn die Kraft erzeugt ja nicht mo- 
mentane Verrückung, sondern Beschleunigung, d. h. eine Geschwindigkeits- 
änderung während einer kleinen Zeit, und die Geschwindigkeitsänderung 
führt erst wieder mit der Zeit zu einer Verrückung. Erst wenn diese im 
vollen Betrage da ist, erreicht die Kraft auf das nächste Teilchen ihren 
vollen Betrag, und von da wiederholt sich der Vorgang jedesmal mit einem 
von der' Masse der Teilchen abhängigen Zeitverluste. Würde die Kraft, 
die vom ersten Teilchen bei seiner Verrückung ausgeht, direkt das letzte 
Teilchen der Reihe beeinflussen, so würde die Wirkung momentan erfolgen. 
Dies soll nach der Newtonschen Gravitationstheorie bei der gegenseitigen 



86 



Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 



Anziehung der Himmelskörper der Fall sein; die Kraft, die einer auf den 
andern ausübt, ist immer nach dem momentanen Ort des ersten hin ge- 
richtet und durch die momentane Entfernung der Größe nach bestimmt. 
Man sagt, die Newtonsche Gravitation ist eine Fernwirkung'^ denn sie 
wirkt ohne Vermittelung des dazwischenliegenden Mediums in die Ferne. 
Im Gegensatze dazu ist unsere Reihe äquidistanter Körperchen das 
einfachste Modell für eine Nahwirkting\ denn die vom ersten auf den 
letzten Punkt ausgeübte Wirkung wird durch die dazwischenliegenden 
Massen vermittelt und tritt daher nicht momentan, sondern mit einer 
Verzögerung ein. Die von einem Teilchen auf seine Nachbarn ausgeübte 
Kraft ist dabei allerdings noch als Fernwirkung gedacht, wenn auch nur 
über eine kurze Entfernung; man kann aber nun die Abstände der Teil- 
chen immer kleiner und kleiner vorstellen, ihre Zahl dafür in entsprechen- 
dem Maße immer größer und größer, aber so, daß ihre gesamte Masse 
dieselbe bleibt. Dann geht die Kette von Massenteilchen in den Grenz- 
begriff eines materiellen Kontinuums über; die Kräfte wirken zwischen un- 
endlich benachbarten Teilchen und die Bewegungsgesetze nehmen die 
Gestalt von Differentialgleichungen an. Diese sind der mathematische 
Ausdruck für den physikalischen Begriff der Nahwirkung. 

Wir wollen diesen Grenzprozeß an den Bewegungsgesetzen unserer 

Kette von Massenteilchen etwas näher 
verfolgen. 

Wir betrachten etwa rein trans- 
versale Verrückungen (Abb. 67). In der 
Elastizitätstheorie wird angenommen, 

daß ein Teilchen P von einem seiner 

Nachbarn Q um so stärker zurückge- 
zerrt wird, je mehr es über Q hin- 
aus transversal verschoben ist; ist u der Überschuß der transversalen Ver- 
schiebung von P über die von Q und a der ursprüngliche Abstand der 
Teilchen auf der Geraden, so soll die zurückziehende Kraft proportional 

11 
dem Verhältnisse — = d sein, das man Deformation nennt. Wir setzen 
a 

u 
K=p '— =pd, 
a 

wo / eine konstante Zahl ist, die offenbar gleich der Kraft ist, wenn die 
Deformation ^=1 gewählt wird. Man bezeichnet / als Elastizitäts- 
konstante. 

Dasselbe Teilchen erfährt nun von seinem andern Nachbarn R eben- 

falls eine solche Kraft K* = p — =^pd'. Aber außer in dem singulären 

a 

Falle, daß der Ausschlag von P gerade ein Maximum ist, wird das 
Teilchen R stärker verschoben sein, als P, also dieses nicht zurück- 
zuziehen, sondern seine Verschiebung zu vergrößern suchen. K' wird 
also K entgegenwirken. 



^ Q ^ P ^ R ^ 
Abb. 67. 



Der Äther als elastischer Festkörper. gy 



Die resultierende Kraft auf das Teilchen P ist die Differenz dieser 
Kräfte 

K— K' =p(d—d'). 

Diese bestimmt nun die Bewegung von F nach der dynamischen Grund- 
formel Masse mal Beschleunigung gleich Kraft: 

mb = K—K' =zp(d—d'). 

Nun denke man sich die Anzahl der Teilchen immer mehr vermehrt, ihre 
Masse aber im selben Verhältnis verkleinert, so daß die Masse pro Längen- 
einheit immer denselben Wert behält. Gehen auf die Längeneinheit n 

Teilchen, so ist ;z • ^ = i, also ;z = — . Die Masse pro Längeneinheit 

'in 
ist mn = — ; man nennt diese Größe (lineare) Massendichte und be- 

zeichnet sie mit q. Indem man nun obige Gleichung durch a dividiert, 

bekommt man

--b = Qb = =/ — — , 

a a a 

und hier hat man nun ganz ähnliche Bildungen vor sich, wie sie bei der 
Definition der Begriffe Geschwindigkeit und Beschleunigung auftraten. 
Wie nämlich die Geschwindigkeit das Verhältnis des Weges x zur Zeit /,

V =^ — , war, wobei für eine beschleunigte Bewegung die Zeitdauer / als

ganz kurz zu denken ist, so haben wir hier die Deformation d = — ,

das Verhältnis von relativer Verschiebung zu ursprünglicher Entfernung, 
wobei diese als äußerst klein zu denken ist. Genau wie früher die Be-

d—d' . . . . ..

Genau wie Geschwindigkeit v und Beschleunigung b für beliebig ab-

behalten die Größen d und / bei beliebig abnehmender Distanz a ihren 
Sinn und endlichen Wert; all das sind sogenannte Differentialquotienten,

des Vorganges. Von diesem Typus sind alle Nahwirküngsgesetze der 
theoretischen Physik. Handelt es sich z. B. um nach allen Richtungen 
ausgedehnte, elastische Körper, so kommen noch ganz analog gebaute 
Glieder für die beiden andern Raumdimensionen hinzu. Aber auch in 
der Theorie der elektrischen und magnetischen Vorgänge gelten ganz ähn- 
liche Gesetze; schließlich ist auch die Gravitationstheorie durch Einstein 
auf eine solche Gestalt gebracht worden. 

Wir müssen hier noch anmerken, daß man Fern Wirkungsgesetze formell 
als Nahwirkungsformeln schreiben kann. Streichen wir z. B. in unserer 
Gleichung (36) das Glied qb^ nehmen also an, daß die Massendichte 
unendlich klein sei, so wird eine Verrückung des ersten Teilchens im 
selben Augenblick eine Kraft auf das letzte Teilchen hervorrufen, weil die 
Trägheit der übermittelnden Glieder in Fortfall gekommen ist. Wir haben 
also eigentlich die Ausbreitung einer Kraft mit unendlicher Geschwindig- 
keit, eine richtige Fern Wirkung; trotzdem erscheint das Gesetz pf = o 
in der Form einer Differentialgleichung, einer Nahwirkung. Solchen 
Pseudo-Nahwirkungsgesetzen werden wir in der Theorie der Elektrizität 
und des Magnetismus begegnen, wo sie den eigentlichen Nahwirkungs- 
gesetzen den Weg gebahnt haben. Das Wesentliche an letzteren ist das 
Trägheitsglied, das die endliche Fortpflanzungsgeschwindigkeit von Gleich- 
gewichtsstörungen, also das Zustandekommen von Wellen, bewirkt. 

In dem Gesetze (36) kommen zwei Größen vor, die den physikalischen 
Charakter der Substanz bestimmen, die Masse pro Einheit des Volumens 

P 
oder Dichte ^ und die Elastizitätskonstante /. Schreibt man 3 = — /, 

so sieht man, daß bei gegebener Deformation, also gegebenem /, die Be- 
schleunigung um so größer wird, je größer / und je kleiner q ist; / ist 
eben ein Maß für die elastische Steifigkeit der Substanz, q für die Massen- 
trägheit, und es ist klar, daß eine Vergrößerung der Steifigkeit die Be- 
wegung beschleunigt, eine Vermehrung der Trägheit sie verlangsamt. Die 
Geschwindigkeit c einer Welle wird daher auch nur von dem Verhältnisse 

^^ abhängen; denn je schneller die Welle läuft, um so größer sind die 

Beschleunigungen der einzelnen Teilchen der Substanz. Das genaue Ge- 
setz für diesen Zusammenhang findet man durch folgende Überlegung: 
Jeder einzelne Massenpunkt vollführt eine einfache^ periodische Be- 
wegung von der Art, wie wir sie früher (II, 11, S. 30) untersucht haben. 
Dort haben wir gezeigt, daß dabei die Beschleunigung mit dem Aus- 
schlage X nach der Formel (11) 

b = [27tvYx 

zusammenhängt, wo v die Anzahl der Schwingungen in der Sekunde ist; 
führt man statt dessen die Schwingungsdauer nach der Formel (34), S. 76, 

2^= — ein, so wird

Dieselbe Überlegung die hier für das zeitliche Nacheinander angestellt 
worden ist, kann man auch auf das räumliche Nebeneinander anwenden 
und muß dabei zu ganz entsprechenden Beziehungen gelangen; man hat 
einfach die Beschleunigung b (den zweiten, zeitlichen DifFerentialquotienten) 
durch die Größe / (den zweiten, örtlichen DifFerentialquotienten) und die 
Schwingungsdauer T (die zeitUche Periode) durch die Wellenlänge X (die

Diese Beziehung gilt für alle Körper, mögen sie gasförmig, flüssig oder 
fest sein. 

Nur besteht folgender Unterschied: 

In Flüssigkeiten tmd Gasen gibt es keinen elastischen Widerstand gegen 
seitliche Verschiebung der Teilchen, sondern nur gegen Volumänderung; 
daher können* sich in solchen Sub- 
stanzen nur longitudinale Wellen 
fortpflanzen, deren Geschwindig- 
keit durch die für Volumände- 
rungen maßgebende Elastizitäts- 
konstante/ nach der Formel (37) 
bestimmt wird. 

Dagegen können sich m festen 
Körpern wegen der elastischen 
Steifigkeit gegen seitliche Ver- 
rückungen in jeder Richtung 
drei Wellen mit verschiedenen 
Geschwindigkeiten fortpflanzen, 
eine longitudinale und zwei trans- 
versale; das kommt daher, weil für die Verdichtungen und Verdünnungen 
der longitudinalen Wellen eine andere Elastizitätskonstante / maßgebend 
ist, als für die seitlichen Verzerrungen der transversalen Schwingungen.

In nicht-kristallinischen Körpern haben übrigens die beiden transversalen 
Wellen zwar verschiedene, aufeinander senkrechte Schwingungsrichtungen, 
aber die gleiche Geschwindigkeit Ct\ die longitudinale Welle hat eine 
andere Geschwindigkeit ci (Abb. 68). 

Alle diese Tatsachen lassen sich durch das Experiment an Schallwellen 
in festen Körpern bestätigen. 

Wir kommen nun auf den Ausgangspunkt dieser Betrachtungen zurück, 
nämlich auf die elastische Lichttheorie. 

Diese besteht darin, daß man den Äther als Träger der Licht- 
schwingungen identifiziert mit einem festen, elastischen Körper; die 
Lichtwellen sollen dann also gewissermaßen Schallwellen in diesem hypo- 
thetischen Medium sein. 

Welche Eigenschaften muß man nun diesem elastischen Äther zu- 
schreiben? 

Zunächst fordert die ungeheure Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeit <:, daß 
entweder die elastische Steifigkeit / sehr groß oder die Massendichte q 
sehr klein ist, oder daß beides zugleich gilt. Da aber die Licht- 
geschwindigkeit in verschiedenen Substanzen verschieden ist, so muß der 
Äther innerhalb eines materiellen Körpers entweder verdichtet oder seine 
Elastizität muß verändert sein, oder auch beides zugleich. Man sieht, 
daß sich hier verschiedene Wege eröffnen. Die Anzahl der Möglichkeiten 
wird noch dadurch vermehrt, daß, wie wir sahen (IV, 5, S. 84), durch die 
Experimente nicht entschieden werden kann, ob die Schwingungen des 
polarisierten Lichtes parallel oder senkrecht zur Polarisationsebene (der 
Einfallsebene des polarisierenden Spiegels) stattfinden. 

Entsprechend dieser Unbestimmtheit des Problems finden wir auch 
historisch eine unübersehbare Zahl verschiedener Theorien des elastischen 
Äthers. Wir haben die Namen der wichtigsten Autoren schon genannt; 
neben den französischen Mathematikern Poisson, Fresnel, Cauchy und 
dem Engländer Green tritt hier zum ersten Male ein bedeutender deut- 
scher Physiker auf, Franz Neumann, der der Lehrer der großen, deut- 
schen Physiker- Generation Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, Clausius wurde. 

Es nimmt uns heute wunder, wie viel Scharfsinn und Mühe auf das 
Problem gewandt worden ist, die optischen Erscheinungen in ihrer Gesamt- 
heit aufzufassen als Bewegungen eines elastischen Äthers von denselben 
Eigenschaften, wie sie die materiellen elastischen Festkörper haben. Es 
scheint uns, als läge eine Überspannung des Prinzips vor, das da besagt: 
Erklären heißt, Unbekanntes auf Bekanntes zurückführen. Denn wir 
wissen heute, daß das Wesen des elastischen Festkörpers gar nicht etwas 
Einfaches und erst recht nicht etwas Bekanntes ist; die Physik des Äthers 
hat sich als einfacher und durchsichtiger erwiesen, als die Physik der 
Materie, und die moderne Forschung ist bestrebt, die Konstitution der 
Materie als sekundäres Phänomen auf die Eigenschaften der Kraftfelder 
zurückzuführen, die vom Äther der älteren Physik übriggeblieben sind. 
Aber diese Wandlung des wissenschaftlichen Programms beruht nicht zum 



Der Äther als elastischer Festkörper. g i 



wenigsten auf den Mißerfolgen der Bemühungen, eine konsequente Theorie 
des elastischen Äthers durchzuführen. 

Ein gewichtig erscheinender Einwand gegen diese Lehre ist der, daß ein 
den Weltenraum erfüllender Äther von der großen Steifigkeit, die er als Träger 
der raschen Lichtschwingungen haben muß, der Bewegung der Himmels- 
körper, besonders der Planeten, einen Widerstand entgegensetzen müßte. 
Die Astronomie hat aber niemals Abweichungen von den Newtonschen 
Bewegungsgesetzen gefunden, die auf einen solchen Widerstand hindeuten 
könnten. Stokes (1845) hat diesen Einwand einigermaßen entkräftet 
durch die Bemerkung, daß auch der Begriff der Festigkeit eines Körpers 
durchaus etwas Relatives ist und von dem zeitlichen Verlaufe der defor- 
mierenden Kräfte abhängt. Ein Stück Pech — Siegellack und Glas ver- 
halten sich ähnlich — springt bei einem Hammerschlag mit scharfem, 
glattem Bruche; belastet man es aber mit einem Gewichte, so sinkt dieses, 
wenn auch langsam, allmählich in das Pech ein, als wäre es eine zähe 
Flüssigkeit. Nun verhalten sich die bei den Lichtschwingungen auftretenden 
ungeheuer schnell wechselnden Kräfte (600 Billionen mal in der Sekunde) 
zu den relativ langsamen Vorgängen bei der Planetenbewegung in ihrem 
zeitlichen Ablaufe noch viel extremer, wie der Hammerschlag zur Gewichts- 
belastung. Daher kann der Äther für das Licht wohl als fester, elastischer 
Körper fungieren, gegen die Bewegung der Planeten aber vollkommen 
nachgiebig sein. 

Wenn man sich nun auch mit diesem pecherfüllten Weltenraume be- 
ruhigen will, so ergeben sich ernstere Schwierigkeiten aus den Gesetzen 
der Lichtfortpflanzung selbst. Vor allem tritt bei elastischen Festkörpern 
neben zwei transversalen Wellen immer auch eine longitudinale auf; wenn 
man die Brechung einer Welle an der Grenze zweier Medien verfolgt und 
annimmt, daß die Welle im ersten Medium rein transversal schwingt, so 
entsteht im zweiten Medium notwendig zugleich eine longitudinale Schwin- 
gung. Alle Versuche, dieser Konsequenz der Theorie durch mehr oder 
weniger willkürliche Abänderungen zu entgehen, sind fehlgeschlagen. Man 
kam sogar auf so sonderbare Hypothesen wie die, daß der Äther gegen 
Kompression einen unendlich kleinen oder einen unendlich großen Wider- 
stand habe verglichen mit der Steifigkeit gegen transversale Verzerrung; 
im ersteren Falle würden die longitudinalen Wellen unendlich langsam, im 
zweiten unendlich schnell laufen, jedenfalls aber nicht als Licht in Er- 
scheinung treten. Ein Physiker Mac Cullagh (1839) ging so weit, einen 
Äther zu konstruieren, der sich ganz und gar von dem Vorbilde der ela- 
stischen Körper entfernte; während diese nämlich jeder Entfernungs- 
änderung ihrer Partikel einen Widerstand entgegensetzen, bloßen Drehungen 
aber ohne Widerstand folgen, soll der Mac Cullaghsche Äther sich gerade 
umgekehrt verhalten. Wir können hier auf diese Theorie nicht näher 
eingehen; so merkwürdig sie anmutet, ist sie doch bedeutungsvoll als 
Vorläufer der elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie. Sie führt zu fast denselben 
Formeln wie diese und ist tatsächlich imstande, die optischen Vorgänge 



Q2 Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 



in ziemlichem Umfange richtig darzustellen; aber ihre Schwäche besteht 
darin, daß sie keinen Zusammenhang der optischen Vorgänge mit anderen 
physikalischen Erscheinungen aufdeckte. Es ist klar, daß man durch 
willkürliche Konstruktionen Äthermodelle finden kann, durch die sich 
ein bestimmtes Erscheinungsgebiet darstellen läßt; einen Erkenntniswert 
bekommen solche Erfindungen aber erst dann, wenn sie zu einer Ver- 
schmelzung zweier bis dahin unverbundener physikalischer Gebiete führen. 
Darin liegt der große Fortschritt, den Maxwell durch die Einordnung der 
Optik in die Reihe der elektromagnetischen Phänomene erzielt hat. 

7. Die Optik bewegter Körper. 

Ehe wir diese Entwicklung weiter verfolgen, wollen wir haltmachen 
und die Frage stellen, wie sich die Lehre vom elastischen Äther zum Raum- 
Zeit-Problem und zur Relativität verhält. Während wir bisher bei den 
optischen Untersuchungen die Bewegungen der Licht aussendenden, Licht 
empfangenden und vom Lichte durchstrahlten Körper nicht beachtet haben, 
werden wir jetzt gerade diese Bewegungen ins Auge fassen. 

Der Raum der Mechanik überall dort, wo keine materiellen Körper 
sind, wird als leer betrachtet; der Raum der Optik ist mit Äther erfüllt. 
Der Äther aber gilt uns hier durchaus als eine Art Materie, der eine 
bestimmte Massendichte und Elastizität zukommt. Man kann daher die 
Newtonsche Mechanik mit ihrer Lehre von Raum und Zeit ohne weiteres 
auf die mit Äther gefüllte Welt übertragen. Diese besteht dann nicht 
mehr aus vereinzelten Massen, die durch leere Räume getrennt sind, 
sondern ist ganz und gar von der dünnen Masse des Äthers erfüllt, in 
der die groben Massen der Materie schwimmen; Äther und Materie wirken 
mit mechanischen Kräften aufeinander und bewegen sich nach den Newton- 
Gesetzen. Der Newtonsche Standpunkt ist also gedanklich auf die Optik 
anwendbar; es fragt sich nur, ob die Beobachtungen damit im Einklänge sind. 

Diese Frage kann man nun aber nicht einfach durch eindeutige Ex- 
perimente entscheiden; denn der Bewegungszustand des Äthers außerhalb 
und innerhalb der Materie ist ja nicht bekannt und es steht frei, Hypo- 
thesen darüber auszudenken. Man muß also die Frage so stellen: Lassen 
sich solche Annahmen über die Wechselwirkung der Bewegungen des 
Äthers und der Materie machen, daß die optischen Erscheinungen in ihrer 
Gesamtheit dadurch erklärt werden? 

Wir erinnern uns nun an die Lehre vom klassischen Relativitätsprinzip. 
Danach existiert der absolute Raum nur in eingeschränktem Sinne; denn 
sämtliche Inertialsysteme, die sich geradlinig und gleichförmig gegenein- 
ander bewegen, können mit gleichem Rechte als ruhend im Räume be- 
trachtet werden. Die erste Hypothese über den Lichtäther, die sich auf- 
drängt, wird nun die sein: 

Der Äther im Weltenraume weit außerhalb der materiellen Körper ruht 
in einem Inertialsysteme. 



Die Optik bewegter Körper. 



93 



Denn wäre das nicht der Fall, so würden Teile des Äthers beschleu- 
nigt sein, es würden Fliehkräfte in ihm auftreten und als deren Folge 
Änderungen der Dichte und Elastizität, und es wäre zu erwarten, daß 
man davon durch das Licht der Gestirne Kenntnis bekommen hätte. 

Diese Hypothese genügt der Form nach dem klassischen Relativitäts- 
prinzip; wenn der Äther zu den materiellen Körpern gerechnet wird, 
so sind Translationsbewegungen der Körper gegen den Äther ebensogut 
relative Bewegungen wie die zweier Körper gegeneinander, und eine ge- 
meinsame Translationsbewegung des Äthers und aller Materie würde \yeder 
mechanisch noch optisch nachweisbar sein. 

Aber die Physik der materiellen Körper allein^ ohne den Äther^ braucht 
nun nicht mehr dem Relativitätsprinzipe zu genügen; eine gemeinsame 
Translation aller Materie ohne Teilnahme des Äthers, also eine Relativ- 
bewegung gegen diesen, könnte sich sehr wohl durch optische Experi- 
mente feststellen lassen. Dann würde der Äther praktisch ein absolut 
ruhendes Bezugsystem definieren. Die Frage, auf die es im folgenden 
vor allem ankommt, ist nun die, ob die beobachtbaren optischen Er- 
scheinungen nur von den relativen Bewegungen der materiellen Körper 
abhängen, oder ob die Bewegung im Äthermeer sich bemerkbar macht. 

Eine Lichtwelle wird durch 3 Merkmale gekennzeichnet: 

1. die Schwingungszahl oder Frequenz, 

2. die Geschwindigkeit, 

3. die Fortpflanzungsrichtung. 

Wir werden nun systematisch untersuchen, welchen Einfluß relative 
Bewegungen der Licht aussendenden und Licht empfangenden Körper 
gegeneinander und gegen das über- 
tragende Medium, sei es der Äther 
im freien Weltenraume, sei es 
eine durchsichtige Substanz, auf 
diese drei Merkmale der Lichtwelle 
haben. 

Die Methode, die wir dabei an- 
wenden, ist diese: Wir betrachten 
einen Wellenzug, der zur Zeit 
/ = o den Nullpunkt O in irgend- 
-einer Richtung verläßt, und zählen 
die einzelnen Wellen, die einen 
beliebigen Punkt -P bis zur Zeit t 
überstreichen. Diese Anzahl ist 
ofifenbar völlig unabhängig davon, 

•in welchem Bezugsysteme die Koordinaten von P gemessen werden, mag 
•dieses ruhen oder bewegt sein. Man bestimmt sie folgendermaßen: 

Die erste Welle, die den Nullpunkt im Augenblicke / = o verläßt, 
«nuß eine gewisse Strecke s fortschreiten (Abb. 69), bis sie den Punkt P

04 Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 

erreicht, und braucht dazu die Zeit — . Von diesem Moment an zählen 

c 

wir die über P hinweg gehenden Wellen^ bis zum Moment /, also wäh- 

rend der Dauer t . Da nun das Licht in i Sekunde v Schwingungen 

ausführt und jeder vorbeiziehenden Welle gerade eine Schwingung ent- 
spricht, so ziehen in i sec v Wellen, also in t sec v \t j 

Wellen am Punkte P vorbei. ^ \ ^ I 

Die Wellenzahl v U J ist also nur davon abhängig, wie die 

beiden Punkte O und P zueinander und zu dem Wellenzuge liegen und 
wie groß der Zeitunterschied t zwischen dem Abgange der ersten Welle 
in O und der Ankunft der letzten in P ist. Mit dem Bezugsystem hat 
diese Zahl nichts zu tun; sie ist also eine Invariante in dem Sinne, den 
wir diesem Worte oben gegeben haben. 

Man macht sich das am besten klar, wenn man die Ausdrucksweise 
Minkowskis benützt. Danach ist der Abgang der ersten Welle zur Zeit 
/ = o vom Nullpunkt ein Ereignis, ein Weltpunkt, die Ankunft der 
letzten Welle zur Zeit t am Punkte P ein anderes Ereignis, ein zweiter 
Weltpunkt. Weltpunkte aber sind da ohne Bezug auf bestimmte Koor- 
dinatensysteme; und da die Wellen zahl v[t ) nur durch die beiden 

Weltpunkte bestimmt ist, so ist sie unabhängig vom Bezugsysteme, in- 
variant. 

Daraus folgen dann leicht, entweder durch anschauliche Überlegung 
oder durch Anwendung der Galilei-Transformationen, alle Sätze über das 
Verhalten der 3 Merkmale der Welle, der Frequenz, Richtung und Ge- 
schwindigkeit, bei einem Wechsel des Bezugsystems. Wir werden diese 
Sätze der Reihe nach ableiten und mit der Erfahrung vergleichen. 

8. Der Dopplers che Effekt. 

Daß die beobachtete Frequenz einer Welle von der Bewegung sowohl 
der Lichtquelle, als auch des Beobachters gegen das übertragende Medium 
abhängt, hat Christian Doppler (1842) entdeckt. Die Erscheinung 
läßt sich bei Schallwellen leicht beobachten; der Pfiff einer Lokomotive 
erscheint höher, wenn diese sich dem Beobachter annähert, und wird im 
Augenblicke des Vorbeifahrens tiefer. Die sich annähernde Schallquelle trägt 
die Impulse vorwärts, so daß sie schneller aufeinander folgen. Einen ähnlichen 
Effekt hat die Bewegung des Beobachters dem Schall entgegen; er empfängt 
dann die Wellen in rascherer Aufeinanderfolge. Dasselbe muß nun auch 
beim Licht der Fall sein. Die Frequenz des Lichtes bestimmt aber seine 
Farbe, und zwar entsprechen die schnellen Schwingungen dem violetten, 
die langsamen dem roten Ende des Spektrums. Daher wird bei einer 



Der Dopplersche Effekt, qc 



Annäherung der Lichtquelle und des Beobachters die Farbe des Lichtes 
ein wenig nach Violett, bei Entfernung nach Rot verschoben. 

Diese Erscheinung ist nun tatsächlich beobachtet worden. 

Das von leuchtenden Gasen kommende Licht besteht nicht aus allen 
möglichen Schwingungen, sondern aus einer Anzahl getrennter Frequenzen; 
das Spektrum, das ein Prisma oder ein auf Interferenz beruhender Spek- 
tralapparat davon entwirft, zeigt kein kontinuierliches Farbenband wie der 
Regenbogen, sondern einzelne, scharfe, bunte Linien. Die Frequenz 
dieser Spektrallinien ist für die chemischen Elemente charakteristisch, die in 
der Flamme leuchten (Spektralanalyse von Bunsen und Kirchhoff 1859). 
Auch die Gestirne haben solche Linienspektren, deren Linien zum größten 
Teile mit denen irdischer Elemente zusammenfallen; woraus zu schließen 
ist, daß die Materie in den fernsten Weltenräumen aus denselben Ur- 
bestandteilen zusammengesetzt ist. Aber die Sternlinien stimmen nicht 
genau mit den entsprechenden irdischen überein, sondern zeigen kleine 
Verschiebungen, in einem Halbjahr nach der einen, im zweiten nach der 
anderen Seite. Diese Frequenzänderungen sind die Wirkungen des Doppler- 
effekts der Erdbewegung um die Sonne; während des einen Halbjahrs 
läuft die Erde auf einen bestimmten Fixstern zu, daher wird die Frequenz 
aller von diesem kommenden Lichtwellen vergrößert und die Spektral- 
linien des Sterns erscheinen nach der Seite der schnellen Schwingungen 
(Violett) verschoben, während des zweiten Halbjahrs entfernt sich die Erde 
von dem Sterne, die Verschiebung der Spektrallinien erfolgt also nach 
der anderen Seite (Rot). 

Diese wunderbare Abbildung der Erdbewegung im Spektrum der 
Sterne tritt allerdings nicht rein in die Erscheinung; denn es ist klar, 
daß sich ihr der Dopplersche Effekt bei der Aussendung des Lichtes 
von einer bewegten Lichtquelle überlagern wird. Wenn nun die Fix- 
sterne nicht sämtlich im Äther ruhen, so muß ihre Bewegung sich wieder 
als Verschiebung der Spektrallinien bemerklich machen; diese tritt zu der 
von der Erdbewegung erzeugten hinzu, zeigt aber nicht den jährlichen 
Wechsel und läßt sich daher von ihr abtrennen. Astronomisch ist diese 
Erscheinung noch viel wichtiger, denn sie gibt Aufschluß über die Ge- 
schwindigkeiten auch der fernsten Gestirne, soweit bei der Bewegung 
eine Annäherung oder Entfernung von der Erde stattfindet. Doch ist es 
nicht unsere Aufgabe, näher auf diese Untersuchungen einzugehen. 

Uns interessiert vor allem die Frage: 

Was geschieht, wenn sich Beobachter und Lichtquelle in gleicher 
Richtung und mit gleicher Geschwindigkeit bewegen? Verschwindet dann 
der Dopplersche Efifekt, hängt er nur von der relativen Bewegung der 
materiellen Körper ab, oder verschwindet er nicht und verrät dadurch 
die Bewegung der Körper durch den Äther? Im ersteren Falle würde 
das Relativitätsprinzip für die optischen Vorgänge zwischen materiellen 
Körpern erfüllt sein. 

Die Äthertheorie gibt auf diese Frage folgende Antwort: 



96 



Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 



Der Dopplersche Effekt hängt nicht nur von der relativen Bewegung 
der Lichtquelle und des Beobachters ab, sondern auch ein wenig von 
den Bewegungen beider gegen den Äther; aber dieser Einfluß ist so 
klein, daß er sich der Beobachtung entzieht, überdies ist er in dem Falle 
einer gemeinsamen Translation der Lichtquelle und des Beobachters 
streng gleich Null. 

Das letztere ist anschaulich so klar, daß es kaum betont zu werden 
braucht; man hat sich nur zu überlegen, daß die Wellen in irgend zwei 
relativ zueinander ruhenden Punkten in demselben Rhythmus vorüber- 
ziehen, gleichgültig, ob die beiden Punkte im Äther ruhen oder sich ge- 
meinsam bewegen. Trotzdem gilt das Relativitätsprinzip für den Licht 
aussendenden und den Licht empfangenden Körper nicht strenge sondern 
nur angenähert. Wir wollen das beweisen. 

Dazu verwenden wir den oben abgeleiteten Satz von der Invarianz 
der Wellenzahl. 

Wir lassen vom Nullpunkt des im Äther ruhenden Systems S einen 

Wellenzug in der ^-Richtung abgehen 
und zählen die Wellen, die bis zur Zeit / 
einen beliebigen Punkt P überstreichen 
(Abb. 70). Der Weg, den die Wellen 
dabei zurückzulegen haben, ist gleich der

Nun betrachten wir ein in der ^-Richtung 
mit der Geschwindigkeit v bewegtes System 
*S', in dem der Beobachter an einer Stelle 
mit der Koordinate x ruhen möge; zur 
Zeit / = o sollen S und S' zusammen- 
fallen, und zur Zeit t soll der Beobachter

wo V und / die vom bewegten Beobachter gemessene Frequenz und 
Geschwindigkeit sind. Es gilt also 



(38) 



''('-t) = '''('-z)' 



wobei die Koordinaten durch die Galileische Transformation (29), S. 59, 

x' = X — vf oder x = x -\- vt 
verknüpft sind. Setzt man das ein, so erhält man 



Der Dopplersche Effekt. gy 



(39) 



/ x' + vt\ ,1 x'\ 



und das muß natürlich für alle Werte von x' und f gelten. Wählt man 
speziell / = i, x = o, so folgt 

(40) v\^i-^j = v\ 

Das ist das gesuchte Gesetz; es drückt aus, das ein in derselben Rich- 
tung wie die Lichtwellen bewegter Beobachter eine Frequenz v' mißt, 

die im Verhältnis ( i 1 : i verkleinert ist. 



(-t) 



Wir betrachten jetzt umgekehrt eine Lichtquelle, die mit der Fre- 
quenz Vq schwingt und sich in der Richtung der ^jc-Achse mit der Ge- 
schwindigkeit v^ bewegt; ein im Äther ruhender Beobachter messe die 
Frequenz v. Dieser Fall ist sofort auf den vorigen zurückführbar; denn, 
ob Lichtquelle oder Beobachter, ist für die Betrachtung ganz gleichgültig, 
es kommt nur darauf an, mit welchem Rhythmus die Wellen einen be- 
wegten Punkt treffen. Jetzt ist der bewegte Punkt die Lichtquelle; wir 
erhalten also die Formel für diesen Fall aus der früheren, wenn wir darin 
V durch v^ und v' durch r^ ersetzen: 



.{.-^)=.„; 



hier ist aber v^ als Frequenz der Lichtquelle gegeben, r als beobachtete 
Frequenz gesucht. Also muß man nach r auflösen und erhält 

(41) v = —^ 



Die beobachtete Frequenz erscheint also, da der Nenner kleiner als i 

ist, vergrößert, im Verhältnis i ^ ( i ^) • 

Man sieht nun sogleich, daß es nicht gleichgültig ist, ob sich der 
Beobachter in der einen oder die Lichtquelle in der entgegengesetzten 
Richtung mit derselben Geschwindigkeit bewegen. Denn setzt man in 
der Formel (41) v^=^ —v, so wird sie 



V = 



^+7 



und dies ist von (40) verschieden. Allerdings ist der Unterschied in allen 
praktischen Fällen sehr gering. Wir haben früher (IV, 3, S. 74) gesehen, 
daß das Verhältnis der Geschwindigkeit der Erde auf ihrer Bahn um die 

Sonne zu der des Lichtes ß= — = 1:10000 ist, und ähnliche kleine

denn wenn man ß^ = = io~^ neben i vernachlässigt, so

Werte von ß gelten für alle kosmischen Bewegungen. Dann ist aber mit 
großer Näherung

ist {i-^ß)(i^ß) = i-ß^=l. 

1) 

Diese Vernachlässigung des Quadrates von ß =■ — wird im folgen- 
den eine große Rolle spielen. Sie ist fast immer erlaubt, weil so winzige 
Größen wie /^^ = io~^ nur in wenigen Fällen der Beobachtung zugäng- 
lich sind. Man klassifiziert nun überhaupt die Erscheinungen der Optik 
(und Elektrodynamik) bewegter Körper danach, ob sie von der Größen- 
ordnung ß oder ß^ sind, und nennt die ersteren Größen i. Ordnung^ die 
letzteren Größen 2. Ordnung bezüglich ß. In diesem Sinne können wir sagen: 

Der Dopplersche Effekt hängt nur von der relativen Bewegung der 
Lichtquelle und des Beobachters ab, wenn man Größen 2. Ordnung ver- 
nachlässigt. 

Man sieht das auch, wenn man eine gleichzeitige Bewegung von Licht- 
quelle (Geschwindigkeit z^o) und Beobachter (Geschwindigkeit z;) annimmt; 
dann erhält man offenbar die beobachtete Frequenz v' ^ wenn man v aus 
(41) in (40) einsetzt: 

V 

I — 

V ■ 

V ' 



c 

Haben Lichtquelle und Beobachter die gleiche Geschwindigkeit, v^ = v, 
so hebt sich der Bruch ganz fort, und es folgt v' = r^'^ der Beobachter 
bemerkt also nichts von einer gemeinsamen Bewegung mit der Licht- 
quelle gegen den Äther. Aber sobald v von z/^ verschieden ist, entsteht 
ein Dopplerscher Effekt, dessen Größe nicht nur von der Differenz der 
Geschwindigkeiten v — v^ abhängt ; dadurch ließe sich die Bewegung 
gegen den Äther feststellen, wenn der Unterschied nicht 2. Ordnung, 
also viel zu klein wäre, um beobachtet werden zu können. 

Wir sehen, daß der Dopplersche Effekt kein praktisch brauchbares 
Mittel ist, um Bewegungen gegen den Äther im Weltenraume zu kon- 
statieren. 

Wir wollen noch hinzufügen, daß es gelungen ist, den Dopplerschen 
Effekt mit irdischen Lichtquellen aufzufinden. Dazu muß man äußert rasch 

bewegte Lichtquellen haben, damit das Verhältnis ß = — emen merk- 
lichen Wert bekommt. J. Stark (1906) verwandte dazu die sogenannten 
Kanalstrahlen. Bringt man in einer evakuierten, mit stark verdünntem 
Wasserstoff gefüllten Röhre zwei Elektroden an, von denen die eine K

durchbohrt ist, und macht man diese zum negativen Pol (Kathode) einer 
elektrischen Entladung (Abb. 71), so entstehen einmal die bekannten Ka- 
thodenstrahlen, sodann aber dringt, wie Goldstein (1886) entdeckt hat, 
durch das Loch der Kathode ein rötliches Leuchten, das von rasch be- 
wegten, positiv geladenen Wasserstoffatomen oder -molekeln herrührt. 
Die Geschwindigkeit dieser Kanalstrahlen ist von der Größenordnung

Stark untersuchte das Spektrum der Abb. 71. 

Kanalstrahlen und fand, daß die hellen 

Linien des Wasserstoffs die zu erwartende, auf dem Dopplerschen Effekte 
beruhende Verschiebung zeigen. Diese Entdeckung hat für die physika- 
lische Atomistik eine große Bedeutung gewonnen; doch gehört das nicht 
zu unserm Thema. 

Zuletzt müssen wir noch erwähnen, daß durch Belopolski (1895), 
Galizin (1907) eine Art Dopplerscher Effekt mit Hilfe irdischer Licht- 
quellen und bewegter Spiegel nachgewiesen worden ist. 



9. Die Mitführung des Lichtes durch die Materie. 

Wir gelangen nun zur Untersuchung des zweiten Merkmals einer Licht- 
welle, nämlich ihrer Geschwindigkeit. Nach der Äthertheorie ist die Ge- 
schwindigkeit des Lichtes eine durch die Massendichte und die Elastizität 
des Äthers bestimmte Größe; sie hat also im Äther des Weltenraumes 
einen festen Wert, in jedem materiellen Körper einen andern, der davon 
abhängen wird, wie die Materie den Äther in ihrem Innern beeinflußt und 
bei ihrer Bewegung mitführt. 

Behandeln wir zunächst die Lichtgeschwindigkeit im Weltenraume, 
so müssen wir schließen , daß ein gegen den Äther bewegter Beobachter 
eine andere Geschwindigkeit messen wird als ein ruhender; denn hier 
gelten offenbar die elementaren Gesetze der Relativbewegung. Wenn der 
Beobachter in derselben Richtung sich bewegt wie das Licht, so wird 
dessen Geschwindigkeit um den Betrag der Geschwindigkeit v des Beob- 
achters gegen den Äther verkleinert erscheinen; Ja, man könnte sich 
Wesen denken, die das Licht überholen. Dasselbe ergeben auch die oben 
abgeleiteten Formeln, die die allgemeinen Beziehungen zwischen den 
Eigenschaften des Lichtes ausdrücken, wie sie zwei in relativer Trans- 
lation befindliche Beobachter feststellen. Setzt man in der Formel (39) 
/ = o, .t' = I, so erhält man 

V V

und wenn man hier den Ausdruck für v' aus (40) einsetzt: 

V V l v\ 

— = — I , 

c c \ c I 

oder, da v sich forthebt: 

(42) c' = c li ) ^^ ^ — ^• 

Das bedeutet, die Lichtgeschwindigkeit im bewegten System bestimmt 
sich nach den Regeln der relativen Bewegung. 

Man kann dies auch so auffassen, daß ein durch den Äther bewegter 
Beobachter von einem Ätherwind umspült wird, der die Lichtwellen ver- 
weht, gerade wie über ein schnell fahrendes Automobil die Luft streicht 
und den Schall mit sich trägt. 

Damit ist nun aber ein Mittel gegeben, die Bewegung etwa der Erde 
oder des Sonnensystems gegen den Äther festzustellen. Wir haben zwei 
wesentlich verschiedene Methoden, die Lichtgeschwindigkeit zu messen, 
eine astronomische und eine terrestrische; die erste, das alte Verfahren 
Römers, benutzt die Verfinsterungen der Trabanten des Jupiter, mißt 
also die Geschwindigkeit des durch den Weltenraum vom Jupiter zur 
Erde eilenden Lichtes, bei der andern nehmen Lichtquelle und Beob- 
achter an der Erdbewegung teil. Geben nun beide Methoden genau das- 
selbe Resultat, oder sind Abweichungen vorhanden, die eine Bewegung 
gegen den Weltäther verraten? 

Maxwell (1879) hat darauf aufmerksam gemacht, daß durch die Beob- 
achtung der Verfinsterungen der Jupitermonde eine Bewegung des ganzen 

Sonnensystems gegen den Welt- 
äther feststellbar sein müßte. 
Man denke sich den Planeten 
Jupiter in dem Punkte A (Abb. 
72) seiner Bahn, der der Bahn 
der Sonne bei der Bewegung 
des Sonnensystems in der 
Richtung dieser Bewegung am 
nächsten liegt. (In der Ab- 
bildung ist angenommen, daß 
die Jupiterbahn die Bahn des 
Sonnensystems in A triö"t.) 
Abb. 72. Während eines Jahres entfernt 

sich Jupiter nur wenig von A^ 
da seine Umlaufszeit etwa 1 2 Jahre beträgt. In einem Jahre durchläuft die 
Erde einmal ihre Bahn, und durch Beobachtung der Verfinsterungen läßt 
sich die Zeit finden, die das Licht braucht, um den Durchmesser der 
Erdbahn zu durchlaufen. Da sich nun das ganze Sonnensystem in der 
Richtung von der Sonne nach A bewegt, so läuft das Licht vom Jupiter 
nach der Erde dieser Bewegung entgegen, seine Geschwindigkeit er-

scheint vergrößert. Nun wartet man 6 Jahre, bis der Jupiter im ent- 
gegengesetzten Punkte B seiner Bahn steht; jetzt läuft das Licht in 
derselben Richtung wie das Sonnensystem, braucht also zum Durcheilen 
der Erdbahn längere Zeit, seine Geschwindigkeit erscheint kleiner. 

Wenn sich der Jupiter bei A befindet, müssen sich die Verfinsterungen 
eines seiner Satelliten während eines halben Erdjahres um die Zeit 

/ = verzögern, wobei / den Durchmesser der Erdbahn bedeutet; 

"- c-\-v 

l 
wenn der Jupiter bei B steht, beträgt die Verzögerung 4 = ' 

Wäre das Sonnensystem ruhend im Äther, so würden beide Verzöge- 
rungen einander gleich, nämlich /q = — sein; ihre tatsächliche Differenz 

(I I \ 2lv 2lv 

für die man bei Vernachlässigung von ß^ neben i auch 

schreiben kann, gestattet eine Bestimmung von ß und damit der Ge- 
schwindigkeit V = ßc des Sonnensystems gegen den Äther. Nun braucht 
das Licht von der Sonne zur Erde etwa 8 Minuten, also ist /^ = 1 6 Minuten 
oder rund t^ = looo sec; man würde also aus einer Zeitdifferenz 

- ^ I , . 300 000 , , 

L — 4 = 1 sec auf ß = oder v = ßc = =150 km/sec 

2000 2000 

schließen müssen. 

Die Relativgeschwindigkeiten der Fixsterne gegen das Sonnensystem, 
die sich aus dem Dopplerschen Effekt ableiten lassen, liegen meist in der 
Größenordnung 20 km/sec; es kommen aber bei gewissen Sternhaufen 
und Spiralnebeln Geschwindigkeiten bis 300 km/sec vor. Die Genauig- 
keit der astronomischen Zeitbestimmungen hat bisher nicht ausgereicht, 
um eine Verzögerung der Verfinsterungen eines Jupitertrabanten um i sec 
oder weniger während eines halben Jahres festzustellen; doch ist es nicht 
ausgeschlossen, daß es durch Verfeinerung der Beobachtungskunst erreich- 
bar sein wird. 

Auch ein auf der Sonne befindlicher Beobachter, dem der Wert der 
Lichtgeschwindigkeit im ruhenden Äther bekannt ist, könnte mit Hilfe 
der Verfinsterungen der Jupitertrabanten die Bewegung des Sonnensystems 
durch den Äther feststellen; er müßte dazu die Verzögerung der Ver- 
finsterungen während eines halben Umlaufs des Jupiters messen. Dafür 
gilt dieselbe Formel 4 — /, = 2^/?, nur bedeutet jetzt 4 die Zeit, die 
das Licht zum Durchlaufen des Halbmessers der Jupiterbahn braucht. 
Dieser Wert /^ ist (etwa 2,5 mal) größer als der oben gebrauchte von 
16 Minuten für die Erdbahn, und im selben Verhältnis wird die Ver- 



I02 Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 

zögerung t^ — /^ größer; aber dafür ist die Dauer des Jupiterumlaufs, 
während dessen die Verfinsterungen fortlaufend verfolgt werden müssen, 
viel (etwa 12 mal) größer als das Erdjahr, so daß diese Methode, die 
auch von einem irdischen Beobachter angewandt werden könnte, keinen 
Vorteil zu versprechen scheint. 

■Jedenfalls ist durch die Tatsache, daß man mit der heute erreich- 
baren Genauigkeit von einigen Sekunden keine Verzögerung gefunden hat, 
der Beweis erbracht, daß die Geschwindigkeit des Sonnensystems gegen 
den Äther nicht beträchtlich größer ist als die höchsten, bekannten Re- 
lativgeschwindigkeiten der Gestirne gegeneinander. 

Wir wenden uns jetzt zu den terrestrischen Methoden der Messung 
der Lichtgeschwindigkeit. Hier ist leicht einzusehen, warum diese keine 
Schlüsse auf die Bewegung der Erde durch den Äther erlauben; wir haben 
auf den Grund schon oben hingewiesen, als wir diese Methoden zum 
ersten Male erwähnten (IV, 3, S. 75). Das Licht läuft nämlich dabei ein 
und denselben Weg hin und zurück ; gemessen wird nur eine mittlere Ge- 
schwindigkeit auf dem Hin- und Hergange, die Abweichung dieser von 
der Lichtgeschwindigkeit c im Äther ist aber eine Größe 2. Ordnung be- 
züglich ß und entzieht sich der Beobachtung. Ist nämlich / die Weg- 
länge, so ist die Zeit, die das Licht zum Hinwege in der Richtung der 

/ 

Erdbewegung braucht, gleich , die Zeit für den Rückweg ebenso

also die ganze Zeit

[c ~\- v) [c — v) c"" — v'^ 

Die mittlere Geschwindigkeit ist 2/ dividiert durch diese Zeit, also 
gleich 

unterscheidet sich demnach von c nur um Größen 2. Ordnung. 

Außer der direkten Messung der Lichtgeschwindigkeit gibt es zahl- 
lose, andere Experimente, bei denen die Lichtgeschwindigkeit ins Spiel 
kommt. Sämtliche Interferenz- und Beugungsphänomene beruhen darauf, 
daß Lichtwellen auf verschiedenen Wegen zum selben Orte gelangen und 
dort sich überlagern; die Brechung an der Grenze zweier Körper ent- 
steht durch die Verschiedenheit der Lichtgeschwindigkeit in ihnen, somit 
geht diese in die Wirkung aller optischen Apparate ein, die Linsen, 
Prismen oder dgl. enthalten. Kann man nicht Anordnungen ausdenken 
bei denen die Bewegung der Erde und der dadurch erzeugte »Äther- 
wind« sich bemerkbar machen? 

Es sind sehr viele Versuche zur Entdeckung dieser Bewegung er- 
sonnen und ausgeführt worden. Eine allgemeine Erfahrung lehrt, daß 



Die Mitführung des Lichtes durch die Materie. I03 

bei Experimenten mit irdischen Lichtquellen niemals der geringste Ein- 
fluß des Ätherwindes merkbar ist; es sind auch besondere Versuche an- 
gestellt worden, die dasselbe beweisen. Allerdings handelt es sich dabei 
bis in die neueste Zeit um Versuchsanordnungen, die nur Größen erster 
Ordnung in ß zu messen erlauben. Daß diese immer ein negatives Re- 
sultat ergeben müssen, folgt aber leicht daraus, daß dabei niemals die 
wirkliche Zeitdauer der Lichtbewegung von einer Stelle zur andern, son- 
dern nur Unterschiede solcher Zeiten für denselben Lichtweg oder ihre 
Summen für Hin- und Rückweg gemessen werden; dabei heben sich 
aus dem oben erörterten Grunde immer die Größen i. Ordnung fort. 

Man könnte aber ein positives Resultat erwarten, wenn man nicht 
eine irdische, sondern eine astronomische Lichtquelle nimmt. Wenn man 
ein Fernrohr auf einen Stern richtet, auf den die momentane Geschwindig- 
keit V der Erde gerade hinweist (Abb. 73), so wird die Geschwindigkeit 
des Lichtes in den Linsen des Fernrohrs relativ zur Substanz des Glases 
um v größer sein, als wenn die Erde ruhte, und wenn man denselben 
Stern nach einem halben Jahre durch 
das Fernrohr betrachtet, so wird die 
Lichtgeschwindigkeit in den Linsen 
um V kleiner sein. Da nun die Größe 
der Brechung in einer Linse durch 
die Lichtgeschwindigkeit bestimmt 
wird, so könnte man erwarten, daß 
der Brennpunkt der Linse in beiden 
Fällen eine verschiedene Lage hat. Abb. 73. 

Das wäre ein Effekt erster Ordnung; 
denn der Unterschied der Lichtgeschwindigkeit in beiden Fällen wäre 2 Vy 

und sein Verhältnis zur Geschwindigkeit im ruhenden Äther — = 28. 

c 

Arago hat diesen Versuch tatsächlich ausgeführt, aber keinerlei 
Unterschied der Lage des Brennpunkts gefunden. Wie ist das zu er- 
klären? 

Wir haben oben offenbar die Voraussetzung gemacht, daß die Licht- 
geschwindigkeit in einem Körper, der gegen den Äther dem Strahl ent- 
gegen mit der Geschwindigkeit v bewegt wird, genau um diesen Betrag 
größer ist, als wenn der Körper im Äther ruhte. Mit andern Worten: 
Wir haben angenommen, daß der materielle Körper durch den Äther 
hindurchstreicht, ohne ihn im geringsten mitzunehmen, wie ein Netz, das 
vom Fischerboot durch das Meerwasser geschleppt wird. 

Das Versuchsergebnis lehrt, daß das offenbar nicht der Fall ist. Viel- 
mehr muß der Äther an der Bewegung der Materie teilnehmen; es fragt 
sich nur, wieviel. 

Fresnel stellte fest, daß zur Erklärung der Aragoschen Beobachtung 
und aller andern Effekte i. Ordnung genügt, daß der Äther nur zum Teile 
von der Materie mitgeführt wird. Wir werden diese Theorie, die später 




I04 



Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 



experimentell aufs glänzendste bestätigt wurde, sogleich eingehend be- 
sprechen. 

Den radikaleren Standpunkt, daß der Äther innerhalb der Materie voll- 
ständig an deren Bewegung teilnimmt, hat später vor allem Stokes (1845) 
vertreten. Er nahm an, daß die Erde den Äther in ihrem Innern mit 
sich führt und daß diese Ätherbewegung allmählich nach außen abnimmt, 
bis zur Ruhe des Weltäthers. Es ist klar, daß dann alle Lichterscheinungen 
auf der Erde genau so ablaufen, als wenn diese ruht; damit aber das von 
den Gestirnen kommende Licht nicht in der Übergangsschicht zwischen 
dem Weltäther und dem mitgeführten Äther der Erde Ablenkungen und 
Änderungen seiner Geschwindigkeit erfahre, muß man besondere Hypo- 
thesen über die Bewegungen des Äthers machen. Stokes fand eine solche, 
die allen optischen Bedingungen genügte; aber später wurde nachgewiesen, 
daß sie mit den Gesetzen der Mechanik nicht im Einklänge sei. Zahl- 
reiche Versuche, die Stokessche Theorie zu retten, haben zu keinem Ziele 
geführt, und sie wäre an inneren Schwierigkeiten gescheitert, auch wenn 
die Fresnelsche Theorie nicht durch Fizeaus Versuch (s. unten S. 105) be- 
stätigt worden wäre. 

Der Fresnelsche Gedanke der teilweisen Mitführung läßt sich aus dem 
Aragoschen Versuche nicht leicht ableiten, weil die Brechung in Linsen 
ein verwickelter Vorgang ist, der nicht nur die Geschwindigkeit, sondern 
auch die Richtung der Wellen betrifft. Es gibt aber ein völlig gleich- 
wertiges Experiment, das von Hoek 
später (1868) ausgeführt wurde und 
viel durchsichtiger ist. Es läuft im 
Prinzip auf folgende Interferometer- 
Anordnung heraus (Abb. 74). Von 
der Lichtquelle Q fällt das Licht auf 
eine gegen die Strahlrichtung unter 
45° geneigte, halbdurchlässig versil- 
berte Glasplatte P, an der es geteilt 
wird; der reflektierte Strahl (Strahl i) 
Abb. 74. trifft der Reihe nach die Spiegel S^ , 

»Sg, ^'3, die mit /'ein Rechteck bilden, 
und wird bei der Rückkehr nach P zum Teil in das Beobachtungsfernrohr 
F reflektiert, der durchgehende Strahl (Strahl 2) durchläuft denselben Weg 
in umgekehrtem Sinne und gelangt im »Gesichtsfelde mit dem ersten zur 
Interferenz. Zwischen S^ und S^ wird nun ein durchsichtiger Körper, 
etwa ein mit Wasser gefülltes Rohr W eingeschaltet, und der ganze 
Apparat wird so montiert, daß die Richtung von S^ nach S^ abwechselnd 
parallel und entgegen der Erdbewegung um die Sonne gestellt werden 
kann. Die Geschwindigkeit des Lichtes in ruhendem Wasser sei c^\ dieser 
Wert ist etwas kleiner als die Geschwindigkeit im Vakuum, und das Ver- 

c 
hältnis beider — = « heißt Brechungsindex. Die Geschwindigkeit in 




Die Mitführung des Lichtes durch die Materie. 105 



Luft ist von c nur unmerklich verschieden, der Brechungsindex der Luft 

also fast genau gleich i. Nun wird das Wasser von der Erde auf ihrer 

Bahn mitgeführt. Würde der Äther im Wasser an dieser Bewegung gar 

nicht teilnehmen, so wäre die Lichtgeschwindigkeit im Wasser relativ zum 

Weltäther unverändert c^ , also für einen in der Richtung der Erdbewegung 

laufenden Strahl relativ zur Erde c^ — v\ würde der Äther vom Wasser 

vollkommen mitgenommen, wäre die Lichtgeschwindigkeit relativ zum 

Weltäther c^ -\- v, relativ zur Erde c^ . Wir wollen keins von beiden von 

vornherein annehmen, sondern den Betrag der Mitführung unbestimmt 

lassen; es sei die Lichtgeschwindigkeit im bewegten Wasser relativ zum 

Weltäther etwas größer als ^j, etwa c^ + (jp, also relativ zur Erde c^ + (jP — v. 

Wir wollen die unbekannte Mitführungszahl cp aus dem Experimente finden ; 

ist sie Null", so findet gar keine, ist sie v^ so findet vollständige Mitführung 

statt, ihr wirklicher Wert muß zwischen diesen Grenzen liegen. Eines 

aber wollen wir annehmen: daß die Mitführung in Luft gegen die in 

Wasser zu vernachlässigen ist. 

Nun sei / die Länge des Wasserrohres; dann braucht der Strahl i zum 

/ . . 

Durchlaufen des Rohres die Zeit , wenn die Erde sich in der 

c^-\-(p — v 

Richtung von S^ nach S^ bewegt; derselbe Strahl braucht zur Durch- 
laufung der entsprechenden Luftstrecke zwischen S^ und P die Zeit 

/ . 
— — - — ; im ganzen ist also die Zeit , die der Strahl i zur Durchlaufung 

der beiden gleichen Wege in Wasser und Luft braucht: 



c^ -\- cp — V c -{- V 

Der Strahl 2 läuft umgekehrt herum; er durchläuft erst die Luftstrecke 

in der Zeit , dann die Wasserstrecke in der Zeit , im 

ganzen also braucht er auf den gleich langen Wegen in Luft und Wasser 
die Zeit: 



C — V c^ — (p -\-v 

Nun zeigt das Experiment, daß die Interferenzen sich nicht im ge- 
ringsten ändern, wenn der Apparat in die entgegengesetzte oder in irgend 
eine andere Richtung zur Erdgeschwindigkeit gedreht wird. Daraus folgt, 
daß die Strahlen i und 2 unabhängig von der Orientierung des Apparates 
gegen die Erdbahn gleiche Zeiten brauchen, daß also

etwas umständliche Ausrechnung ^) und teilen nur das Resultat mit, das 
bei Vernachlässigung von Größen zweiter und höherer Ordnung lautet:

Das ist die berühmte Mitführungsformel Fresnels, der sie allerdings 
auf anderm, mehr spekulativem Wege gefunden hat. Ehe wir seinen 
Ansatz mitteilen, stellen wir fest, was die Formel eigentlich aussagt. Die 
Mitführung ist danach um so größer, je mehr der Brechungsexponent den 
Wert I, den er im Vakuum hat, übertrifft. Für Luft ist c^ nahezu gleich ^, 
n nahezu gleich i, also cp fast genau Null, wie wir es oben vorausgesetzt 
haben. Je größer das Lichtbrechungsvermögen, um so vollständiger ist 
die Mitführung des Lichtes. Die Geschwindigkeit des Lichtes in einem 
bewegten Körper ist nun, gemessen relativ zum Weltäther

andere Dichte an, wird sich also mit einer anderen Geschwindigkeit v^ 
gegen den Körper weiterbewegen; aus denselben Gründen wie oben muß 
nämlich ihre Masse auch gleich q^v^ sein, und es gilt 

oder

v^ = — V . 

Das ist gewissermaßen die Stärke des Ätherwindes in dem mit der Ge- 
schwindigkeit V bewegten Balken. Das Licht, das gegen den verdichteten 
Äther die Geschwindigkeit c^ hat, hat gegen den Körper die Geschwin- 
digkeit

c,—v, ■= c^——v. 

Nun haben wir aber gesehen, daß nach dem Ergebnisse des Hoekschen 
Versuches die Lichtgeschwindigkeit gegen den bewegten Körper

beträgt. Folglich muß 



Q ^ ± ^ fi 



sein; die Verdichtung —^ ist also gleich dem Quadrate des Brechungs- 
index. 

Hier kann man weiter schließen, daß die Elastizität des Äthers in 
allen Körpern die gleiche sein muß; denn die Formel (37) (S. 89) lehrt, 

p 
daß in jedem elastischen Medium c^ = -~ ist. Also gilt im Äther 

p = c^Q^ in der Materie p^ = c^q^; diese beiden Ausdrücke sind aber 
nach obigem Resultate über die Verdichtung einander gleich. 

Diese mechanische Deutung der Mitführungszahl durch Fresnel hat 
auf den Ausbau der elastischen Lichttheorie großen Einfluß ausgeübt. 
Wir dürfen aber nicht verhehlen, daß man gewichtige Einwände gegen 
sie erheben kann. Bekanntlich hat Licht von verschiedener Farbe 
(Schwingungszahl) verschiedene Brechbarkeit n, also verschiedene Ge- 
schwindigkeit. Daraus folgt, daß die Mitführungszahl für jede Farbe 
einen andern Wert hat. Das ist aber mit der Fresnelschen Deutung un- 
vereinbar, denn dann müßte der Äther je nach der Farbe mit anderer 
Geschwindigkeit im Körper strömen; es gäbe also so viele Äther, wie 
Farben, und das ist doch unmöglich. 

Ganz ohne Rücksicht auf die mechanische Deutung ist aber die Mit- 
führungsformel (43) auf die Ergebnisse von Versuchen begründet. Wir 
werden sehen, daß sie in der elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie aus Vor- 



io8

Stellungen über die atomistische Struktur der Materie und der Elektrizität 
abgeleitet wird. 

Durch irdische Experimente die Fresnelsche Formel zu prüfen, ist sehr 

schwierig, weil dazu durchsichtige Substanzen sehr schnell bewegt werden 

, müssen. Der Versuch ist Fizeau 

(1851) mit Hilfe einer empfind- 
S^ y \ ' I \ .?, liehen Interferometer -Anordnung 

gelungen. 

Der von ihm benutzte Apparat 
ist ganz ähnlich dem von Hoek, 
nur sind dezde Lichtwege 5^ S^ 
und S^P mit Röhren versehen, 
'^n durch die Wasser strömen kann, 
und zwar so, daß der Strahl i 
ganz mit dem Wasser, der Strahl 2 
/" ganz gegen das Wasser läuft (Abb. 

76). Fizeau prüfte, ob das Wasser 
das Licht mit sich führt, indem 
er beobachtete, ob sich die Inter- 
ferenzen verschoben, wenn das Wasser in rasche Bewegung gesetzt wird. 
Das war in der Tat der Fall, aber lange nicht in dem Maße, das voll- 
ständiger Mitführung entspricht; die genaue Messung ergab vorzügliche 
Übereinstimmung mit der Fresnelschen Mitführungsformel (43). 

10. Die Aberration. 

Wir diskutieren jetzt den, Einfluß der Bewegung der Körper auf die J^üA- 
tung der Lichtstrahlen, insbesondere die Frage, ob sich durch Beobachtungen 
von Richtungsänderungen die Bewegung der Erde durch den Äther feststellen 

läßt. Dabei ist wiederum zu unter- 
^^ scheiden, ob es sich um eine astrono- 

mische oder eine irdische Lichtquelle 
handelt. 

Die scheinbare Ablenkung des von 
den Fixsternen zur Erde gelangenden 
Lichtes ist die Aberration^ die wir 
schon vom Standpunkte der Emis- 
sionstheorie diskutiert haben (IV, 3, 
S. 72). So einfach die dort gegebene 

. Erklärung ist, so verwickelt ist die 

^ Sache vom Standpunkte der Wellen- 
"^^ ^ theorie. Denn man sieht leicht ein, 

Abb. 77. daß eine Ablenkung der Wellenebenen 

überhaupt nicht stattfindet. Am deut- 
lichsten erkennt man das, wenn die Strahlen senkrecht zur Bewegung des 
Beobachters einfallen; dann sind die Wellenebenen dieser Bewegung parallel 



P 



(^ 



Die Aberration. 



lOQ 



und werden von dem bewegten Beobachter ebenso wahrgenommen (Abb. 77). 
Dasselbe lehrt aber auch die Rechnung. Wir legen ein ruhendes Koordinaten- 
system S und ein bewegtes S' so, daß die x- bzw. ^Jc'-Achse in die Be- 
wegungsrichtung fällt, und zählen die Wellen, die vom Moment / = o an 
bis zum Moment / einen beliebigen Punkt F überstrichen haben; diese 

Anzahl ist, wie wir wissen, v U j , wo s der von den Wellen zurück- 
gelegte Weg ist. Offenbar ist im Falle senkrecht auftreffender Wellen 
s =y. 

Die Invarianz der Wellenzahl erfordert, daß 



.(,_z) =.(,_/) 



ist, wenn die Koordinaten mit der Galilei-Transformation umgerechnet 
werden. Bei dieser bleibt aber die ^y-Koordinate ungeändert, daher muß 

, V v' , 

p = v' und — = -y- also c = c 
c c 

sein. Der bewegte Beobachter sieht also eine Welle von genau derselben 
Frequenz, Geschwindigkeit und Richtung; denn wäre diese verändert, so 
müßte die Wellenzahl in S' außer von • / auch von x abhängen. 

Es scheint also, daß die Wellentheorie nicht imstande ist, die einfache 
und seit fast 200 Jahren bekannte Erscheinung der Aberration zu er- 
klären. 

Aber so schlimm liegt die Sache nicht. Der Grund für den Miß- 
erfolg der eben angestellten Überlegung ist der, daß die optischen 
Instrumente, mit denen die Beobachtungen gemacht werden und zu denen 
auch das unbewaffnete Auge gehört, gar nicht die Lage der ankommenden 
Wellenfront feststellen, sondern eine ganz andere Leistung vollbringen. 

Man bezeichnet die Funktion des Auges oder des Fernrohrs als optische 
Abbildung^ und sie besteht darin, daß die von einem leuchtenden Objekte 
ausgehenden Strahlen zu einem Bilde vereinigt werden. Dabei wird die 
Schwingungsenergie der Teilchen des Objekts von den Lichtwellen nach 
den entsprechenden Teilchen des Bildes transportiert. Die Wege dieses 
.Energietransportes sind nun tatsächlich die physikalischen Strahlen. Energie 
aber ist eine Größe, die nach dem Erhaltungssatze wie eine Substanz 
wandern und sich umformen, aber nicht entstehen und verschwinden kann. 
Daher ist es plausibel, daß man auf ihre Bewegung die Gesetze der Emis- 
sionstheorie anwenden kann. Tatsächlich ist die einfache, früher (S. 73) 
gegebene Ableitung der Aberrationsformel ganz richtig, wenn man die 
Lichtstrahlen als die Energiebahnen der Lichtwellen definiert und auf 
diese die Gesetze der Relativbewegung anwendet, als wären sie Ströme 
geschleuderter Partikel. 

Man kann aber auch ohne Anwendung dieses Begriffes der Strahlen als 
Energiebahnen die Aberrationsformel gewinnen, indem man die Brechung 



I I O Die Grundgesetze der Optik. 

der Wellen an den Linsen oder Prismen des optischen Instruments im 
einzelnen verfolgt. Dazu muß eine bestimmte Mitführungstheorie zugrunde 
gelegt werden. Die Stokessche Theorie der vollständigen Mitführung kann 
die Aberration nur durch Annahmen über die Ätherbewegung erklären, 
die mechanisch nicht zulässig sind; wir haben auf diese Schwierigkeiten 
schon oben aufmerksam gemacht. Die Fresnelsche Theorie liefert ein 
Brechungsgesetz der Lichtwellen an der Oberfläche bewegter Körper, aus 
dem genau die Aberrationsformel hervorgeht. Die Substanz der Körper, 
durch die das Licht hindurchgeht, beeinflußt das Resultat nicht, obwohl 
doch die Größe der Mitführungszahl in jeder Substanz eine andere ist. 
Um dies direkt zu prüfen, füllte Airy (187 1) ein Fernrohr mit Wasser 
und stellte fest, daß dabei die Aberration ihre normale Größe hatte. 
Die Aberration als Eff"ekt i. Ordnung verschwindet natürlich, wenn die 
Lichtwelle und der Beobachter keine Relativbewegung gegeneinander 
haben. Daraus folgt auch, daß bei allen optischen Versuchen mit irdischen 
Lichtquellen keine Ablenkung der Strahlen durch den Ätherwind eintritt. 
Die Fresnelsche Theorie ist imstande, diese Tatsachen im Einklänge mit 
der Erfahrung darzustellen. Es erübrigt sich, darauf ausführlich einzugehen. 
Wir brechen nun unsere Erörterungen über den Lichtäther ab und 
werfen einen Blick auf die gewonnenen Einsichten. 

II. Rückblick und Ausblick. 

Wir haben den Lichtäther als Substanz behandelt, die den Gesetzen 
der Mechanik gehorcht. Er genügt also dem Trägheitsgesetze und wird 
daher dort, wo keine Materie ist, im Weltenraume, in einem geeigneten 
Inertialsysteme ruhen. Beziehen wir nun alle Erscheinungen auf ein anderes 
Inertialsystem, so gelten genau die gleichen Gesetze für die Bewegungen 
der Körper und des Äthers, also auch für die Lichtfortpflanzung, aber 
natürlich nur soweit sie Beschleunigungen und wechselseitige Kraftwirkungen 
betreffen. Wir wissen, daß die Geschwindigkeit und die Richtung einer 
Bewegung durchaus verschieden sind bezüglich verschiedener Inertial- 
systeme; kann man doch jeden in gradlinig gleichförmiger Bewegung be- 
findlichen Körper als ruhend auffassen durch bloße Wahl eines geeigneten, 
nämlich mitbewegten Bezugsystems. In diesem, fast trivialen Sinne muß 
also für den als mechanische Substanz gedachten Äther das klassische 
Relativitätsprinzip gelten. 

Daraus folgt aber, daß die Geschwindigkeit 'und Richtung der Licht- 
strahlen in jedem Inertialsystem anders erscheinen müssen. Es wäre also 
zu erwarten, daß durch Beobachtungen der irdischen optischen Erschei- 
nungen, die hauptsächlich durch die Geschwindigkeit und Richtung des 
Lichtes bedingt sind, die Geschwindigkeit der Erde oder des Sonnensystems 
festgestellt werden könnte. Aber sämtliche, zu diesem Zwecke angestellten 
Versuche ergaben ein negatives Resultat. Es stellt sich also heraus, daß 
die. Geschwindigkeit und Richtung der Lichtstrahlen ganz unabhängig sind 



Rückblick und Ausblick. 1 1 1 



von der Bewegung des Weltkörpers, auf dem die Beobachtungen angestellt 
werden. Oder anders ausgedrückt: die optischen Erscheinungen hängen 
nur von den relativen Bewegungen der materiellen Körper ab. 

Das ist ein Relativitätsprinzip, welches ganz ähnlich klingt wie das 
klassische der Mechanik, aber doch einen anderen Sinn hat; denn es be- 
zieht sich auf Geschwindigkeiten und Richtungen von Bewegungsvorgängen, 
und diese sind in der Mechanik nicht von der Bewegung des Bezugsystems 
unabhängig. 

Es sind nun zwei Standpunkte möglich. Der eine geht davon aus, 
daß durch die optischen Erfahrungen tatsächlich etwas prinzipiell Neues 
gegeben ist, nämlich daß Licht sich nach Richtung und Geschwindigkeit 
anders verhält wie materielle Körper. Sobald man die optischen Er- 
fahrungen für zwingend hält, wird man diesen Standpunkt dann vertreten, 
wenn man sich von jeder Spekulation über das Wesen des Lichtes fern- 
halten will. Wir werden sehen, daß Einstein schließlich diesen Weg be- 
schritten hat. Dazu aber gehört eine erhabene Freiheit von den Konven- 
tionen der überkommenen Theorie, die erst dann möglich ist, wenn der 
gordische Knoten von Konstruktionen und Hypothesen so verwickelt ge- 
worden ist, daß das Durchhauen die einzige Lösung bleibt. 

Hier aber stehen wir noch in der Blütezeit der mechanischen Äther- 
theorie, und diese nahm natürlich den anderen Standpunkt ein. Sie mußte 
das optische Relativitätsprinzip als sekundäre, gewissermaßen halb zufällige 
Erscheinung auffassen, hervorgerufen durch die Kompensation von gegen 
einander wirkenden Ursachen. Daß so etwas bis zu einem gewissen Grade 
möglich ist, liegt daran, daß es ja noch freisteht, Hypothesen darüber zu 
machen, wie sich der Äther bewegt, wie er von den bewegten Körpern 
in seiner Bewegung beeinflußt wird. Es ist nun eine große Leistung der 
Fresnelschen Mitfiihrungshypothese, daß sie tatsächlich das optische Re- 
lativitätsprinzip erklärt, soweit Größen i. Ordnung in Betracht kommen. 
Solange die Genauigkeit der optischen Messungen nicht die gewaltige 
Steigerung erfuhr, die nötig ist, um Größen 2. Ordnung zu messen, war 
mit dieser Theorie allen Forderungen der Erfahrung Genüge getan, bis 
auf eine mögliche Ausnahme, die merkwürdigerweise meist wenig beachtet 
wird. Wenn nämlich erhöhte astronomische Messungsgenauigkeit zu dem 
Ergebnis kommen würde, daß durch die Beobachtung der Verfinsterungen 
der Jupitertrabanten nach der alten Methode von Römer (s. S. 100) ein 
Einfluß der Bewegung des Sonnensystems auf die Lichtgeschwindigkeit 
nicht nachweisbar ist, so wäre damit allerdings die Äthertheorie vor eine 
kaum lösbare Aufgabe gestellt; denn es ist klar, daß dieser Effekt i. Ord- 
nung durch keine Hypothese über die Mitführung des Äthers wegdisputiert 
werden könnte. 

Man erkennt nun die Wichtigkeit der experimentellen Aufgabe, die 
Abhängigkeit der optischen Vorgänge von der Erdbewegung bis auf Größen 
zweiter Ordnung zu messen. Erst die Lösung dieses Problems kann die 
Entscheidung bringen, ob das optische Relativitätsprinzip in Strenge gilt

oder nur angenähert. Im ersteren Falle würde die Fresnelsche Äther- 
theorie versagen; man stände dann vor einer neuen Lage. 

Historisch ist diese erst etwa loo Jahre nach Fresnel eingetreten. 
Dazwischen liegt eine Entwicklung der Äthertheorie in anderer Richtung. 
Es gab nämlich zu Anfang nicht nur einen Äther, sondern eine ganze 
Menge: einen optischen, einen thermischen, einen elektrischen, einen 
magnetischen, und vielleicht noch einige mehr. Zu jeder Erscheinung, 
die im Räume vor sich geht, wurde als Träger ein besonderer Äther er- 
funden. Alle diese Äther hatten zunächst nichts miteinander zu tun, 
sondern existierten im selben Räume unabhängig neben- oder besser 
ineinander. Dieser Zustand der Physik konnte natürlich nicht dauern. 
Man fand bald Zusammenhänge zwischen den Erscheinungen der ver- 
schiedenen, zuerst getrennten Gebiete, und so ergab sich schließlich ein 
Äther als Träger aller physikalischen Erscheinungen, die den von Materie 
freien Raum überbrücken. Insbesondere erwies sich das Licht als ein 
elektromagnetischer Schwingungsvorgang, dessen Träger identisch ist mit 
dem Medium, das die elektrischen und magnetischen Kräfte übermittelt. 
Durch diese Entdeckungen fand zunächst die Äthervorstellung eine starke 
Stütze. Schließlich kam es sogar dazu, daß der Äther mit dem Newton- 
schen Räume identifiziert wurde; er sollte in absoluter Ruhe verharren 
und nicht nur die elektromagnetischen Wirkungen vermitteln, sondern 
mittelbar auch die Newtonschen Trägheits- und Fliehkräfte erzeugen. 

Wir werden jetzt diese Entwicklung der Theorie darstellen. Es ist 
wie eine spannende Gerichtsverhandlung; der Äther soll an allem schuld 
sein, Beweis wird auf Beweis gehäuft, bis schließlich der zwingende Nach- 
weis des Alibi der Sache ein Ende macht: Michelsons Experiment über 
die Größen 2. Ordnung und seine Deutung durch Einstein. 



V. Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

I. Die Elektro- und Magneto- Statik. 

Daß ein gewisses Erz, der Magneteisenstein, Eisen anzieht, daß an 
geriebenem Bernstein (griechisch Elektron) kleine, leichte Körperchen 
hängen bleiben, war schon im Altertum bekannt. Aber die Wissenschaften 
vom Magnetismus und der Elektrizität sind doch erst Kinder der Neuzeit, 
die in der Schule Galileis und Newtons gelernt hatte, vernünftige Fragen 
an die Natur zu stellen und die Antwort im Experiment zu verstehen. 

Die Grundtatsachen der elektrischen Erscheinungen wurden etwa vom 
Jahre 1600 an festgestellt; wir wollen sie kurz aufzählen. Als Mittel zur 
Erzeugung elektrischer Wirkungen diente damals ausschließlich die Reibung. 
Gray entdeckte (1729), daß Metalle durch Berührung mit Körpern, die 
durch Reibung elektrisiert sind, ähnliche Eigenschaften bekommen; er 
zeigte, daß die elektrischen Wirkungen in den Metallen fortgeleitet werden 
können. Damit war die Einteilung der Substanzen in Leiter (Konduktoren) 
und Nichtleiter (Isolatoren) gewonnen. Daß die elektrische Wirkung nicht 
immer Anziehung ist, sondern auch Abstoßung sein kann, wurde durch 
du Fay (1730) entdeckt; er deutete diese Tatsache durch die Annahme 
zweier Fluida, die wir heute positive und negative Elektrizität nennen, 
und er stellte fest, daß gleichnamig geladene Körper sich abstoßen, un- 
gleichnamig geladene sich anziehen. 

Wir wollen hier sogleich den Begriff der elektrischen Ladung quanti- 
tativ definieren; dabei halten wir uns nicht streng an die oft recht krausen 
Gedankengänge, die historisch zur Aufstellung der Begriffe und Gesetze 
geführt haben, sondern wählen eine Ordnung der Definitionen und Ex- 
perimente, bei der der logische Zusammenhang möglichst klar zum Vor- 
schein kommt. 

Wir denken uns einen irgendwie durch Reibung elektrisierten Körper M\ 
dieser wirkt nun anziehend oder abstoßend auf andere elektrisierte Körper. 
Wir wollen zum Studium dieser Wirkung kleine Probekörperchen nehmen, 
etwa Kugeln, deren Durchmesser sehr klein sind gegen den nächsten Ab- 
stand vom Körper M^ wo wir die Kraft noch untersuchen wollen. 
Bringen wir einen solchen Probekörper P in die Nähe des Körpers M^ 
dessen Wirkung wir studieren wollen, so erfährt P eine statische Kraft 
von bestimmter Größe und Richtung, die man mit den Methoden der 
Mechanik messen kann, etwa durch Ausbalanzierung gegen ein Gewicht 
mit Hilfe von Hebeln oder Fäden. 

Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. 8 



1 1 4 Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

Nun nehmen wir zwei solche, in verschiedener Weise geriebene Probe- 
körperchen P^ und P^ , bringen sie der Reihe nach an dieselbe Stelle in 
der Nähe von M und messen beidemal die Kräfte K^ und K^ nach 
Größe und Richtung. Dabei wollen wir die Verabredung treffen, daß 
von jetzt an entgegengesetzte Kräfte als gleichgerichtet gelten, aber ihre 
Größen mit umgekehrten Vorzeichen gerechnet werden sollen. 

Der Versuch ergibt, daß die beiden Kräfte gleiche Richtung haben ; 
aber ihre Größe kann verschieden sein und verschiedenes Vorzeichen haben. 

Nun bringen wir die beiden Probekörper an eine andere Stelle in der 
Nähe von M und messen wieder die Kräfte K\ und K'^ nach Größe 
und Richtung; wieder haben beide dieselbe Richtung, aber im allgemeinen 
verschiedene Größen und verschiedenes Vorzeichen. 

Bildet man nun das Verhältnis K^ : K^ der Kräfte an der ersten Stelle, 
dann das Verhältnis K\ : K\ an der zweiten Stelle, so zeigt es sich, daß 
beide den gleichen Wert haben, der positiv oder negativ sein kann: 

Ä = ^. 

Aus diesem Resultat wird man schließen: 

1. Die Richtung der von einem elektrisierten Körper M auf einen 
kleinen Probekörper P ausgeübten Kraft hängt gar nicht von der 
Natur und Elektrisierung des Probekörpers ab, sondern nur von 
den Eigenschaften des Körpers M. 

2. Das Verhältnis der Kräfte auf zwei nacheinander an dieselbe Stelle 
gebrachten Probekörper ist ganz unabhängig von der Wahl der 
Stelle, also von der Lage, Natur und Elektrisierung des Körpers J/". 
Es hängt nur von den Eigenschaften der Probekörper ab. 

Man wählt nun einen bestimmten, in bestimmter Weise elektrisierten 
Probekörper als Einheitskörper und schreibt ihm die Ladung oder Elek- 
trizitätsmenge + 1 zu. Mit diesem mißt man überall die Kraft aus^ 
die der Körper M ausübt; sie sei mit E bezeichnet. Dann bestimmt 
diese auch die Richtung der auf irgendeinen anderen Probekörper P aus- 
geübten Kraft K. Das Größenverhältnis K : E aber hängt nur von dem 
Probekörper P ab und wird seine elektrische Ladung e genannt; diese 
kann positiv oder negativ sein, je nachdem K und E im engeren Sinne 
gleichgerichtet oder entgegengerichtet sind. Es gilt also 

K 

(44) -—•=. e oder K = eE. 

E 

Die Kraft E auf die Ladung i heißt auch elektrische Feldstärke des 
Körpers M\ sie ist bei fixierter Ladungseinheit nur Von der elektrischen 
Natur des Körpers M abhängig, sie bestimmt dessen elektrische Wirkung 
im umgebendem Räume oder, w^ie man sagt, sein -» elektrisches Feld<^, 

Was nun die Wahl der Einheitsladung angeht, so wäre es praktisch 
unmöglich, diese durch eine Vorschrift über die Elektrisierung eines be- 



Die Elektro- und Magneto-Statik. 1 1 5 

Stimmten Probekörpers festzulegen; vielmehr wird man eine mechanische 
Definition für sie suchen. Das gelingt so: 

Man kann zunächst zwei Probekörper gleich stark laden; das Kriterium 
gleicher Ladung ist, daß sie von dem dritten Körper M an derselben 
Stelle dieselbe Kraft erfahren. Dann werden die beiden Probekörper sich 
gegenseitig mit der gleichen Kraft abstoßen ; wir sagen nun, ihre Ladung 
sei I, wenn diese Abstoßung gleich der Krafteinheit wird, sobald die 
Entfernung der beiden Probekörper gleich der Längeneinheit gewählt wird. 
Dabei ist über die Abhängigkeit der Kraft von der Entfernung nicht das 
geringste vorausgesetzt. 

Durch diese Definitionen ist die Elektrizitätsmenge oder elektrische 
Ladung ebensogut eine meßbare Größe, wie Längen, Massen oder Kräfte. 

Das wichtigste Gesetz über die Elektrizitätsmengen, das (1747) un- 
abhängig von Watson und Franklin ausgesprochen wurde, ist der Satz, 
daß bei jedem elektrisierenden Vorgange immer gleiche Mengen positiver 
und negativer Elektrizität entstehen. Reibt man z. B. einen Glasstab mit 
einem seidenen Tuche, so wird der Glasstab positiv elektrisch; genau die 
gleiche negative Ladung findet sich dann auf dem Tuche. 

Diese Erfahrungstatsache läßt sich so deuten, daß die beiden Elektri- 
zitätsarten durch die Reibung nicht erzeugt^ sondern nur getrennt werden. 
Man stellt sie als zwei Fluida vor, die in allen Körpern in gleichen 
Mengen vorhanden sind. In nicht elektrisierten, »neutralen« Körpern 
sind sie überall in gleicher Menge, so daß sich ihre Wirkung nach außen 
aufhebt. In elektrisierten Körpern aber sind sie getrennt; ein Teil der 
positiven Elektrizität ist etwa von einem Körper auf den andern über- 
geflossen, ebensoviel negative in umgekehrter Richtung. 

Es genügt aber offenbar, nur ein Fluidum anzunehmen, das unabhängig 
von der Materie fließen kann ; dann muß man der Materie, die von diesem 
Fluidum frei ist, eine bestimmte Ladung, etwa die positive, zuschreiben, 
dem Fluidum die entgegengesetzte, negative. Die Elektrisierung besteht 
darin, daß das negative Fluidum von einem Körper zum andern über- 
fließt; der erste wird dann positiv sein, weil die positive Ladung der 
Materie nicht mehr ganz kompensiert ist, der andere wird negativ, weil 
er einen Überschuß des negativen Fluidums hat. 

Der Streit zwischen den Anhängern der beiden Hypothesen, der Ein- 
und Zw ei- Fluidum- Theorie^ dauerte lange Zeit und blieb natürlich solange 
unfruchtbar und zwecklos, bis er durch die Entdeckung neuer Tatsachen 
entschieden wurde. Wir gehen auf diese Diskussionen nicht näher ein, 
sondern berichten nur kurz, daß man schließlich charakteristische Unter- 
schiede im Verhalten der beiden Elektrizitäten fand, die darauf hindeute- 
ten, daß die positive Elektrizität tatsächlich fest an der Materie haftet, die 
negative aber frei beweglich ist. Diese Lehre gilt noch heute; wir kommen 
darauf weiter unten bei der Besprechung der Elektronentheorie zurück. 

Ein anderer Streit drehte sich um die Frage, wie die elektrischen 
Anziehungs- und Abstoßungskräfte durch den Raum übertragen werden.

Il6 Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

Die ersten Jahrzehnte elektrischer Forschung standen noch nicht unter 
dem Einflüsse der Newtonschen Attraktionstheorie; eine Wirkung in 
die Ferne erschien undenkbar, es galten metaphysische Sätze wie 
der, daß Materie nur da wirken kann, wo sie ist, und so wurden ver- 
schiedene Hypothesen zur Erklärung der elektrischen Kräfte ersonnen: 
Emanationen, die den geladenen Körpern entströmen und beim Auftreffen 
Druck ausüben, und ähnliche Annahmen. Nachdem aber Newtons 
Gravitationstheorie ihren Siegeszug angetreten hatte, wurde die Vorstellung 
einer unmittelbar in die Ferne wirkenden Kraft allmählich Gewohnheit. 
Denn es ist tatsächlich nichts als Denkgewohnheit, wenn irgendeine Vor- 
stellung sich so den Gehirnen einprägt, daß sie als letztes Erklärungs- 
prinzip gebraucht wird. Zwar dauert es. dann nicht lange, bis die meta- 
physische Spekulation, oft im Gewände kritischer Philosophie, den Beweis 
erbringt, daß das geltende Erklärungsprinzip denknotwendig, sein Gegen- 
teil unvorstellbar sei; aber die fortschreitende, empirische Wissenschaft 
pflegt sich glücklicherweise darum nicht zu kümmern und greift zuweilen, 
wenn neue Tatsachen es fordern, zu den verurteilten Vorstellungen zurück. 
Die Entwicklung der Lehre von den elektrischen und magnetischen Kräften 
ist ein Beispiel eines solchen Kreislaufs der Theorien; am Beginne steht 
eine, auf metaphysische Gründe gestützte Nahwirkungstheorie, sie wird von 
einer Fernwirkungstheorie nach Newtonschem Muster abgelöst, am Schlüsse 
verwandelt diese sich, durch neu entdeckte Tatsachen gezwungen, in eine 
allgemeine Nahwirkungstheorie zurück. Dieses Schwanken ist aber kein 
Zeichen von Schwäche; denn die Bilder, die sich an die Theorien knüpfen, 
sind nicht das Wesentliche, sondern die empirischen Tatsachen und ihre 
begrifflichen Zusammenhänge. Wenn man aber diese verfolgt, so sieht 
man kein Schwanken, sondern eine stetige Entwicklung voll innerer, 
logischer Kraft. Die ersten theoretischen Versuche der vornewtonischen 
Zeit kann man mit Fug aus der Reihe fortlassen, weil die Tatsachen zu 
lückenhaft bekannt waren, um irgendwie zwingende Anhaltspunkte für 
die Theorie zu liefern. Daß dann aber die Fernwirkungstheorie nach dem 
Muster der Newtonschen Mechanik entstand, liegt durchaus im Wesen der 
elektrischen Tatsachen begründet. Eine Forschung, der die experimentellen 
Hilfsmittel des i8. Jahrhunderts zur Verfügung standen, mußte auf Grund 
der zurzeit möglichen Beobachtungen zu der Entscheidung kommen, daß die 
elektrischen und magnetischen Kräfte in derselben Weise wie die Gravita- 
tion in die Ferne wirken. Auch heute noch, vom Standpunkte der hoch 
entwickelten Nahwirkungstheorie Faradays und Maxwells, ist die Dar- 
stellung der Elektro- und Magnetostatik mit Hilfe von Fernkräften durchaus 
erlaubt und führt bei verständigem Gebrauche immer zu richtigen Resultaten. 
Der Gedanke, daß die elektrischen Kräfte wie die Gravitation in die 
Ferne wirken, ist von Äpinus (1759) zuerst gefaßt worden; er ging sogar 
so weit, Gravitation und Elektrizität als Wirkungen desselben Fluidums aufzu- 
fassen. Er stellte sich im Sinne der Ein-Fluidum-Theorie vor, daß Materie 
ohne elektrisches Fluidum andere Materie abstoßen würde, daß aber immer 



Die Elektro- und Magneto-Statik. 1 1 7 




ein kleiner Überschuß des Fluidums da sei, der die Gravitationsanziehung 
bewirke. Die Aufstellung des richtigen Gesetzes für die Abhängigkeit 
der elektrischen Wirkungen von der Entfernung gelang ihm merkwürdiger- 
weise nicht; aber er konnte qualitativ die Erscheinung der Influenz er- 
klären. Diese besteht darin, daß 

ein geladener Körper nicht nur auf /T~+ ~I^ 

andere geladene Körper, sondern ( "*" "^ -~-~y l ^ 

auch auf ungeladene, besonders auf z_i^ 

leitende Körper anziehend wirkt; Abb. 78. 

die gleichnamige Ladung wird 

nämlich auf die dem wirkenden Körper zugewandte, die ungleichnamige 

auf die abgewandte Seite des influenzierten Körpers getrieben (Abb. 78), 

daher überwiegt die Anziehung über die Abstoßung. 

Das wahre Gesetz wurde wohl zuerst von Priestley, dem Entdecker 
des Sauerstoffs, (1767) gefunden, und zwar auf einem geistreichen, in- 
direkten Wege, dessen Beweiskraft im Grunde größer ist, als die der 
direkten Messung. Unabhängig von ihm hat Cavendish (1771) das 
Gesetz auf dieselbe Weise abgeleitet. Seinen Namen aber trägt es nach 
dem Forscher, der es zuerst durch direkte Messungen der Kräfte bewiesen 
hat, Coulomb (1785). 

Jene Überlegung von Priestley und Cavendish läuft etwa auf fol- 
gendes heraus: 

Wenn man einem Leiter (Metall) elektrische Ladung zuführt, so kann diese 
nicht im Innern der leitenden Substanz im Gleichgewicht bleiben, da sich ja 
gleichnamige Ladungsteilchen abstoßen; sie muß vielmehr an die Oberfläche 
drängen, wo sie in einer gewissen Verteilung ins Gleichgewicht kommt. 

Die Erfahrung lehrt nun mit großer Schärfe, daß innerhalb eines rings 
von metallischen Wänden umgebenen Raumes kein elektrisches Feld be- 
steht, mag die Hülle noch so stark geladen sein. Die an der Oberfläche 
des Hohlraums befindlichen Ladungen müssen sich also so verteilen, daß 
die Kraftwirkung auf jeden Punkt im Innern verschwindet. Hat der 
Hohlraum nun insbesondere die Gestalt einer Kugel, so kann aus Sym- 
metriegründen die Ladung nur gleichförmig auf der Oberfläche verteilt 
sein; wenn q die Ladung auf der Flächeneinheit (Ladungsdichte) ist, so 
befinden sich auf zwei Flächenstücken /^ und /^ die Elektrizitätsmengen 
(»/j und q/^. Die Kraft, die ein solches kleines Flächenstück /j auf 
einen im Innern der Kugel befindlichen Probekörper F von der Ladung e 
ausübt, wird dann J^^ = e qf^ R^ sein, wo R^^ die Kraft zwischen zwei in 
P und /i angebrachten Ladungseinheiten bedeutet und irgendwie von der 
Entfernung r, zwischen i^und/^ abhängt. Zu jedem Flächenstück /^ gibt 
es nun ein gegenüberliegendes /j, welches man dadurch erhält, daß man 
die Punkte des Randes von /^ mit F verbindet und diese Linien über F 
hinaus bis zum Schnitt mit der Kugel verlängert; die beiden Flächen- 
stücke /j und /j werden also durch denselben Doppelkegel, mit der 
Spitze F aus der Kugel ausgeschnitten (Abb. 79), und die Winkel zwischen 




1 1 8 Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

ihnen und der Achse des Doppelkegels sind gleich. Die Größen von /^ 
und /a verhalten sich daher wie die Quadrate der Abstände von P : 

^ = -^ 

fr r\ ' 

Von der auf f^ befindlichen Ladung gf^ wird die Kraft K^^=e Qf^ R^ 
auf P ausgeübt, wo R^ irgendwie von r^ abhängt; K^ ist natürlich K^ 
entgegen gerichtet. 

Es liegt nahe anzunehmen, daß sämtliche auf P wirkende Kräfte sich 
nur dann aufheben können, wenn sich die von je zwei gegenüberliegenden 
Flächenstücken herrührenden Kräfte das Gleichgewicht halten, wenn also 
K^ = K^ ist. Man kann diese Annahme beweisen, doch würde uns das hier 

zu weit führen. Lassen wir sie gelten, so folgt 
aus ihr f^R^ =f^R^ oder 

Es ist demnach 

^i^i = R^r\ = ^, 
wo c eine von der Entfernung r unabhängige 
Größe ist. Damit ist R^ und R^ bestimmt, 
nämlich 
Abb. 79. ^ = _^ ^ = _L . 

' -' -'•'•I 2 J -'•'■2 o 

' 1 '2 

Allgemein muß daher die Kraft R zwischen zwei im Abstände r befind- 
lichen Ladungseinheiten den Wert haben: 

r 

Gemäß unserer Verfügung über die Einheit der elektrischen Ladung 

müssen wir c = 1 setzen; denn die Kraft zwischen zwei Ladungseinheiten 

im Abstände i soll gleich i sein. Mit dieser Festsetzung wird die Kraft, die 

zwei Körper mit den Ladungen e^ und e^ im Abstände r aufeinander ausüben 

(45) ^-='4- 

r 

Das ist das Coulo7nbsche Gesetz. Bei seiner Formulierung ist als selbst- 
verständhch vorausgesetzt, daß die größten Durchmesser der geladenen 
Körper klein sind gegen ihren Abstand. Diese Einschränkung drückt aus, 
daß das Gesetz, ebenso wie das der Gravitation, ein idealisiertes Elementar- 
gesetz ist; um daraus auf die Wirkung von Körpern endlicher Ausdeh- 
nung zu schließen, muß man die auf ihnen verteilte Elektrizität in kleine 
Teile zerlegt denken und die Wirkungen aller Teilchen des einen Körpers 
auf alle des anderen paarweise berechnen und summieren. 

Durch die Formel (45) ist die Dimension der Elektrizitätsmenge fest- 

gelegt; denn für die Abstoßung zweier gleicher Ladungen gilt — = ^, 
also e ^= rV K ^ daher ist

Damit ist auch die Einheit der Ladung im cm-g-sec-System bestimmt; man

muß sie schreiben.

Von der Aufstellung des Coulombschen Gesetzes an wurde die Elektro- 
statik eine mathematische Wissenschaft. Das wichtigste Problem ist, bei 
gegebener gesamter Elektrizitätsmenge auf leitenden Körpern die Ver- 
teilung der Ladungen auf diesen unter der Wirkung der gegenseitigen 
Influenz und die daraus entspringenden Kräfte zu berechnen. Die Ent- 
wicklung dieser mathematischen Aufgabe ist darum interessant, weil sie 
sehr schnell von der ursprünglichen Formulierung als Fernwirkungstheorie 
in eine Pseudo-Nahwirkungstheorie verwandelt wurde, d. h. an die Stelle 
der Summationen der Coulombschen Kräfte traten Differentialgleichungen, 
worin als Unbekannte die Feldstärke E^ oder eine damit zusammen- 
hängende Größe, das Potential^ auftrat. Wir können aber auf diese rein 
mathematischen Fragen, um die sich Laplace (1782), Poisson (1813), 
Green (1828) und Gauß (1840) große Verdienste erworben haben, hier 
nicht näher eingehen. Nur einen Punkt wollen wir hervorheben: Es han- 
delt sich bei dieser Behandlung der Elektrostatik, die man gewöhnlich 
Potentialtheorie nennt, um keine eigentliche Nahwirkungstheorie in dem 
Sinne, den wir dem Worte oben (IV, 6, S. 86) gegeben haben; denn die 
Differentialgleichungen beziehen sich auf die örtliche Änderung der Feld- 
stärke von Stelle zu Stelle, aber sie enthalten kein Glied, das eine zeit- 
liche Änderung ausdrückt. Daher bedingen sie keine Ausbreitung der 
elektrischen Kraft mit endlicher Geschwindigkeit, sondern stellen trotz der 
differentiellen Form eine momentane Wirkung in die Ferne dar. 

Die Lehre vom Magnetismus entwickelte sich in ähnlicher Weise wie 
die Elektrostatik. Wir können uns daher kurz fassen. Der wesentlichste 
Unterschied zwischen beiden Erscheinungsgebieten ist der, daß es Körper 
gibt, die Elektrizität leiten, während der Magnetismus immer an die 
Materie gebunden und nur mit dieser beweglich ist. 

Ein langgestreckter, magnetisierter Körper, eine Magnetnadel^ hat zwei 
Pole^ d. h. Stellen, von denen die magnetische Kraft auszugehen scheint, 
und zwar gilt das Gesetz, daß gleichnamige Pole sich abstoßen, ungleich- 
namige sich anziehen. Zerbricht man den Magneten, so werden dadurch 
seine beiden Teile nicht entgegengesetzt magnetisch, sondern jeder Teil 



J20 ^^^ Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 



bekommt an der Bruchstelle einen neuen Pol und stellt wieder einen voll- 
ständigen Magneten mit zwei gleichen Polen dar. Und das gilt, in wie 
kleine Stücke man den Magneten auch zerteilen mag. 

Man hat daraus geschlossen, daß es zwar zwei Arten von Magnetis- 
mus gibt, wie bei der Elektrizität, daß diese aber sich nicht frei be- 
wegen können, sondern in den kleinsten Teilen der Materie, den Molekeln, 
je in gleicher Menge, aber getrennt vorhanden sind. Jede Molekel ist 
also selbst ein kleiner Magnet mit Nord- und Südpol (Abb. 80); die 
Magnetisierung eines endlichen Körpers aber besteht darin, daß alle die 
Elementarmagnetchen, die ursprünglich in völliger Unordnung lagen, parallel 

gerichtet werden. Dann heben

auf, bis auf die der beiden End-

flächen, von denen also alle 
Abb. 80. Wirkung auszugehen scheint. 

Indem man eine sehr lange, 
dünne Magnetnadel benutzt, kann man es erreichen, daß in der Nähe 
des einen Pols die Kraft des anderen schon unmerklich ist. Daher kann 
man auch hier mit Probekörperchen operieren, nämlich den Polen sehr 
langer, dünner Magnetstäbe; mit diesen lassen sich nun alle Messungen 
ausführen, die wir bei der Elektrizität besprochen haben. Man gelangt 
zur Definition der magnetischen Menge oder Polstärke p und der magneti- 
schen Feldstärke H. Die magnetische Kraft , die ein Pol p im Felde H 
erfährt, ist 

(46) K^pH. 

Die Einheit des Poles wird dabei so gewählt, daß zwei Einheitspole 
im Abstände i aufeinander die abstoßende Kraft i ausüben. Das Gesetz, 
wonach sich die Kraft zweier Pole p^ und p^ mit der Entfernung ändert, 
hat ebenfalls Coulomb durch direkte Messung gefunden; es lautet wieder 
wie das Newtonsche Attraktionsgesetz: 

(47) K=f^. 

Offenbar sind die Dimensionen der magnetischen Größen mit denen 
der entsprechenden elektrischen gleich, und ihre Einheiten haben im 
cm-g-sec-System dieselben Zeichen. 

Die mathematische Theorie des Magnetismus läuft der der Elektrizität 
ziemlich parallel; der wesentlichste Unterschied ist der, daß die wahren 
magnetischen Mengen an den Molekeln haften und die meßbaren An- 
häufungen, die das Auftreten der Pole bei endlichen Magneten bedingen, 
nur durch Summation der Wirkungen parallel gerichteter Molekeln ent- 
stehen.

2. Galvanismus und Elektrolyse. 

Die Geschichte der Entdeckung der sogenannten Kontaktelektrizität 
durch Galvani (1780) und Volta (1792) ist so bekannt, daß wir sie 
hier übergehen können; denn so interessant Galvanis Froschschenkelver- 
suche und die sich daran knüpfende Diskussion über den Ursprung der 
elektrischen Ladungen sind, so liegt uns mehr an der klaren Fassung der 
Begriffe und Gesetze. Wir stellen daher nur die Tatsachen fest. 

Taucht man zwei verschiedene Metalle in eine Lösung (Abb. 81), etwa 
Kupfer und Zink in verdünnte Schwefelsäure, so zeigen die Metalle elek- 
trische Ladungen, die genau dieselbe Wirkung ausüben, wie die Reibungs- 
elektrizität. Nach dem Grundgesetz der Elektrizität treten die Ladungen 
beider Vorzeichen an den Metallen (Polen) in gleicher 
Menge auf; das aus Lösung und Metallen bestehende -|- — 

System, auch galvanisches Element oder Zelle genannt, 
besitzt also die Fähigkeit, die Elektrizitäten zu scheiden. 
Das merkwürdige ist nun, daß diese Fähigkeit anschei- 
nend unerschöpflich ist; denn wenn man die Pole durch 
einen Draht verbindet, so daß ihre Ladungen abfließen 
und sich ausgleichen, so sind, sobald der Draht wieder 
entfernt wird, die Pole immer noch geladen. Das 
Element liefert also fortwährend Elektrizität nach, so- 
lange die Drahtverbindung besteht; in dem Drahte 
muß also ein dauerndes Strömen der Elektrizität statt- Abb. 81. 

finden. Wie man sich das im einzelnen vorstellen 
will, hängt davon ab, ob man der Ein- oder der Zwei-Fluidum-Theorie 
anhängt; im ersteren Falle ist nur ein Strom vorhanden, im letzteren 
fließen zwei entgegengesetzte Ströme der beiden Fluida. 

Der elektrische Strom beweist nun seine Existenz durch sehr deutliche 
Wirkungen. Vor allem erhitzt er den Verbindungsdraht. Jeder kennt 
diese Tatsache von den Metallfäden unserer elektrischen Glühbirnen. Der 
Strom erzeugt also dauernd Wärmeenergie. Woher hat das galvanische 
Element die Fähigkeit, fortwährend Elektrizität zu erzeugen und dadurch 
indirekt Wärme zu entwickeln.^ Nach dem Satze von der Erhaltung der 
Energie muß überall da, wo eine Energiesorte bei einem Prozesse zum Vor 
schein kommt, eine andere Energiesorte im gleichen Betrage verschwinden. 

Die Energiequelle ist der chemische Vorgang in der Zelle. Das eine 
Metall löst sich auf, solange der Strom fließt, auf dem anderen schlägt 
sich ein Bestandteil der Lösung nieder; in der Lösung selbst können 
verwickelte chemische Prozesse ablaufen. Wir haben mit diesen nichts 
zu tun, sondern begnügen uns mit der Tatsache, daß die galvanischen 
Zellen ein Mittel sind, um Elektrizität in schier unbegrenzten Mengen zu 
erzeugen und beträchtliche elektrische Ströme herzustellen. 

Wir werden nun aber den umgekehrten Prozeß zu betrachten haben, 
bei dem der elektrische Strom eine chemische Zersetzung herbeiführt. 



122 Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 



Läßt man z. B. den Strom zwischen zwei unzersetzbaren Zuführungs- 
drähten (Elektroden), etwa aus Platin, durch angesäuertes Wasser fließen, 
so zersetzt sich dieses in seine Bestandteile, Wasserstoff und Sauerstoff; 
der Wasserstoff entwickelt sich an der negativen Elektrode (Kathode), der 
Sauerstoff an der positiven (Anode). Die quantitativen Gesetze dieser 
von Nicholson und Carlisle (1800) entdeckten y> Elektrolyse '^ hat 
Faraday (1832) gefunden. Die ungeheure Tragweite der Faradayschen 
Untersuchungen für die Erkenntnis des Aufbaues der Materie, für die 
theoretische und technische Chemie sind bekannt; aber nicht diese ver- 
anlassen uns, hier darauf einzugehen, sondern der Umstand, daß die 
Faradayschen Gesetze das Mittel zur exakten Messung von elektrischen 
Strömen liefern und dadurch den Weiterbau des elektromagnetischen Be- 
griffsystems ermöglichen. 

Den Zersetzungsversuch kann man ebensogut, wie mit einem gal- 
vanischen Strom, auch mit einem Entladungsstrom machen, der entsteht, 
wenn man zwei entgegengesetzt geladene Metallkörper durch einen Draht 
verbindet. Allerdings muß man dabei dafür Sorge tragen, daß die zur 
Entladung kommenden Elektrizitätsmengen groß genug sind; man hat 
Aufspeicherungsapparate für Elektrizität, sogenannte Kondensatoren^ deren 
Wirksamkeit auf dem Influenzprinzip beruht und die so starke Entladungen 
geben, daß meßbare Mengen in der elektrolytischen Zelle zersetzt werden. 
Die Größe der Ladung, die durch die Zelle abfließt, läßt sich mit den 
oben erörterten Methoden der Elektrostatik messen. Faraday hat nun 
den Satz gefunden, daß die doppelte Ladung auch die doppelte Zer- 
setzung hervorruft, die dreifache Ladung die dreifache Zersetzung, kurz 
daß die Menge m des zersetzten Stoffes (oder eines der beiden Zersetzungs- 
produkte) der hindurchgeflossenen Elektrizitätsmenge e proportional ist: 

Cm = e. 

Die Konstante C hängt noch von der Art der Stoffe und des chemi- 
schen Prozesses ab. 

Ein zweites Gesetz von Faraday regelt diese Abhängigkeit. Bekannt- 
lich treten die chemischen Grundstoffe (Elemente) in ganz bestimmten 
Gewichtsverhältnissen zu Verbindungen zusammen. Man bezeichnet die 
Menge eines Elementes, die sich mit i g des leichtesten Elementes 
Wasserstoff verbindet, als sein Äquivalentgewicht. So sind z. B. in Wasser 
[H^O) 8 g Sauerstoff [O] mit i g Wasserstoff [H) verbunden, daher hat 
Sauerstoff das Äquivalentgewicht 8. Der Satz von Faraday besagt nun, 
daß dieselbe Elektrizitätsmenge, die i g Wasserstoff zur Abscheidung 
bringt, von jedem anderen Element genau ein Äquivalentgewicht abzu- 
scheiden vermag, also z. B. von Sauerstoff 8 g. 

Die Konstante C braucht daher nur für Wasserstoff bekannt zu sein, 
dann erhält man sie für jeden anderen Stoff durch Division mit dem 
Äquivalentgewicht. Denn es ist für i g Wasserstoff

durch Division beider Gleichungen folgt

Es ist also Cq = e diejenige Elektrizitätsmenge, die i g Wasserstoff 
abscheidet; ihr Zahlen wert ist durch exakte Messungen festgelegt und 
beträgt im cm-g-sec-System 

(48) Q = 2,90 • 10^'^ Ladungseinheiten pro Gramm. 

Nun kann man die beiden Faradayschen Gesetze in die eine Formel 
zusammenfassen : 

C 

(49) e = - -- m. 

Die elektrolytische Zersetzung bietet also ein sehr bequemes Maß für 
die Elektrizitätsmenge e^ die bei einer Entladung die Zelle passiert hat; 
man braucht nur die Masse m eines Zersetzungsproduktes vom Äquivalent- 
gewicht f.1 zu bestimmen und erhält dann aus der Gleichung (49) die 
gesuchte Elektrizitätsmenge. Dabei ist es natürlich ganz gleichgültig, ob 
diese durch Entladung von aufgeladenen Leitern (Kondensatoren) gewonnen 
wird oder ob sie aus einer galvanischen Zelle stammt. . Im letzteren Falle 
strömt die Elektrizität dauernd mit konstanter Stärke; die Menge, die in 
der Zeiteinheit durch irgendeinen Querschnitt der Leitung, also auch 
durch die Zersetzungszelle passiert, heißt die Stromstärke. Man kann 
diese nun einfach messen, indem man den galvanischen Strom während 
der Einheit der Zeit (i sec) durch die elektrolytische Zelle fließen läßt 
und die Masse m eines Zersetzungsprodukts bestimmt; dann liefert wieder 
die Gleichung (49) diejenige Ladung ^, die gleich der Stromstärke ist. 
Fließt der Strom nicht i sec, sondern t sec, so ist die hindurchgeflossene 
Elektrizitätsmenge ^ und die abgeschiedene Masse m jedes Zersetzungs- 
produktes /mal so groß; die Stromstärke J ist also

3. Widerstand und Stromwärme. 

Wir müssen uns jetzt ein wenig mit dem Strömungsvorgange selbst 
beschäftigen. Man hat den elektrischen Strom stets mit der Strömung 
von Wasser in einer Rohrleitung verglichen und die dort geltenden Be- 
griffe auf den elektrischen Vorgang übertragen. Damit Wasser in einer 



124

Röhre strömt, muß eine treibende Kraft vorhanden sein; läßt man das 
Wasser aus einem höheren Gefäße durch eine geneigte Röhre in ein 
tieferes abfließen, so ist die Schwere die treibende Kraft (Abb. 82). Diese 
ist um so größer, je höher der obere Wasserspiegel über dem unteren 
ist. Aber die Geschwindigkeit des Wasserstromes oder seine Stromstärke 
hängt nicht nur von der Größe des Antriebs durch die Schwere ab, 

sondern außerdem von dem Wider- 
stände, den das Wasser in der Rohr- 
leitung findet. Ist diese lang und eng, 
so ist die pro Zeiteinheit hindurch 
beförderte Wassermenge kleiner als bei 
einem kurzen, weiten Rohre. Die Strom- 
stärke J ist also proportional der 
treibenden Niveaudifferenz V und um- 
gekehrt proportional dem Widerstände 
W\ wir setzen 




Abb. 82. 



(51) /=— oder/^= F, 



wobei als Einheit des Widerstandes der gewählt ist, der bei der Niveau- 
dififerenz F= i die Stromstärke i erzeugt. 

Genau diese Vorstellungen hat nun G. S. Ohm (1826) auf den elektri- 
schen Strom übertragen. Der treibenden Niveaudifferenz entspricht die 
elektrische Kraft; für ein bestimmtes Drahtstück von der Länge /ist F= El 
zu setzen, wo E die längs des Drahtes als konstant betrachtete Feldstärke 
ist. Denn wirkt dasselbe elektrische Feld über eine größere Drahtlänge, 
so liefert es einen größeren Antrieb auf die strömende Elektrizität. Die 
Größe V wird auch Spannung oder elektromotorische Kraft genannt; sie 
ist überdies identisch mit dem Begriffe des elektrischen Potentials, den 
wir oben (S. 119) erwähnt haben. 

Da die Stromstärke J und die elektrische Feldstärke E^ also auch 
die Spannung V ^ El^ meßbare Größen sind, so läßt sich die durch 
das Ohmsche Gesetz (51) ausgedrückte Proportionalität zwischen J und V 
experimentell prüfen. 

Der Widerstand W hängt von dem Material und der Form des Leitungs- 
drahtes ab; je länger und dünner dieser ist, um so größer ist W. Ist / 
die Drahtlänge und q die Größe des Querschnitts, so ist also W mit / 
direkt, mit q indirekt proportional; man setzt 

(52) olV=— oder IV = -^ y 

wo der Proportionalitätsfaktor g nur noch von dem Material des Drahtes 
abhängt und Leitfähigkeit genannt wird. 

Setzt man W aus (52) und F= El in {51) ein, so erhält man 



rw= J — = V= El,

Elektromagnetismus. 125 



und daraus folgt durch Wegheben von /: 

-^ = E oder J~=:öE. 
qo q 

— aber bedeutet die Stromstärke pro Einheit des Querschnitts; man 

nennt diese Stromdichte und bezeichnet sie mit i. Dann gilt also 

(53) i=oE, 

In dieser Form enthält das Ohmsche Gesetz nur noch eine, dem 
Leitermaterial eigentümliche Konstante, die Leitfähigkeit ff, aber nichts 
mehr, was von der Form des leitenden Körpers (Drahtes) abhängt. 

Für Nichtleiter (Isolatoren) ist (7 = 0. Ideale Isolatoren gibt es aber 
nicht; ganz geringfügige Spuren von Leitfähigkeit sind immer vorhanden, 
außer im vollkommenen Vakuum. Man kennt alle Übergänge von den 
schlechten Leitern (wie Porzellan, Bernstein) über die sogenannten Halb- 
leiter (wie Wasser und andere Elektrolyte) zu den Metallen, die eine 
ungeheuer hohe Leitfähigkeit haben. 

Wir haben schon oben darauf hingewiesen, daß der Strom den Leitungs- 
draht erwärmt. Das quantitative Gesetz dieser Erscheinung ist von Joule 
(1841) gefunden worden; es ist offenbar ein spezieller Fall des Satzes 
von der Erhaltung der Energie, indem die elektrische Energie sich in 
Wärme verwandelt. Das Joulesche Gesetz besagt, daß die vom Strom J 
beim Durchlaufen der Spannung Fin der Zeiteinheit entwickelte Wärme gleich 

(54) Q^jv 

ist, wobei Q nicht in Kalorien, sondern in mechanischen Arbeitseinheiten 
zu messen ist. Wir werden von dieser Formel weiter keinen Gebrauch 
machen und teilen sie nur der Vollständigkeit halber mit. 

4. Elektromagnetismus. 

Bisher galten Elektrizität und Magnetismus als zwei Erscheinungsgebiete, 
die zwar mancherlei Ähnlichkeiten haben, aber ganz getrennt und selbständig 
sind. Man suchte natürlich eifrig nach einer Brücke zwischen den beiden 
Gebieten, doch lange ohne Erfolg. Endlich entdeckte Oersted (1820), 
daß Magnetnadeln von galvanischen Strömen abgelenkt werden. Noch im 
selben Jahre fanden Biot und Savart das quantitative Gesetz dieser Er- 
scheinung, das Laplace als Fern Wirkung formulierte. Es ist für uns darum 
yon größter Wichtigkeit, weil darin zum ersten Male eine dem Elektro- 
magnetismus eigentümliche Konstante von der Natur einer Geschwindig- 
keit auftritt, die sich später als identisch mit der Lichtgeschwindigkeit 
erwiesen hat. 

Biot und Savart stellten fest, daß der in einem geraden Drahte fließende 
Strom einen Magnetpol weder an sich zieht, noch von sich stößt, sondern 
ihn auf einem Kreise um den Draht herumzutreiben strebt (Abb. 83), und 



126

y 



zwar einen positiven Pol im Sinne einer Rechtsdrehung (gegen den Uhrzeiger) 
um die (positive) Stromrichtung. Das quantitative Gesetz kann man dadurch 
auf die einfachste Form bringen, daß man den Leitungsdraht in lauter kurze 
Stücke von der Länge / zerlegt denkt und die Wirkung dieser Stromelemente 
angibt, aus der man dann die Wirkung des Gesamt- 
stroms durch Summation erhält. Wir begnügen uns da- 
mit, das Gesetz eines Stromelements für den speziellen 
Fall anzugeben, wo der Magnetpol in der Ebene liegt, 
die durch den Mittelpunkt des Elements geht und auf 
seiner Richtung senkrecht steht (Abb. 84). Dann liegt 
die an dem Magnetpol von der Stärke i angreifende 
Kraft oder magnetische Feldstärke JI in dieser Ebene, 
steht senkrecht auf der Verbindungslinie des Pols mit 
der Mitte des Stromelements und ist der Stromstärke / 
und seiner Länge / direkt, dem Quadrate der Entfer- 
nung r umgekehrt proportional: 




Abb. 83. 



(55) 



cll = 




Abb. 84. 



Äußerlich hat diese Formel wieder Ähnlichkeit mit dem Attraktions- 
gesetze von Newton oder dem Coulombschen Gesetze der Elektrostatik 

und Magnetostatik, aber die elektro- 
magnetische Kraft ist doch von 
ganz anderem Charakter; denn 
sie wirkt nicht in der Verbindungs- 
linie, sondern senkrecht auf dieser. 
Die drei Richtungen y", /-, ^stehen 
paarweise aufeinander senkrecht; 
hier erkennt man, daß die elektro- 
dynamischen Wirkungen aufs 
engste mit der Struktur des eukli- 
dischen Raumes im Zusammenhange stehen, sie liefern gewissermaßen 
ein natürliches rechtwinkliges Koordinatensystem. 

Der in der Formel (55) eingeführte Proportionalitätsfaktor c ist voll- 
ständig bestimmt, da Entfernung r, Stromstärke / und Magnetfeld H 
meßbare Größen sind. Er bedeutet offenbar die Stärke desjenigen Stromes, 
der durch ein Leitungsstück der Länge i fließend im Abstände i das 
Magnetfeld i erzeugt. Es ist üblich und häufig bequem, statt der Strora- 
einheit, die wir eingeführt haben (nämlich die statische Elektrizitätsmenge, 
die in der Zeiteinheit durch den Querschnitt fließt) und die man die 
elektrostatische nennt, diesen Strom von der Stärke c im elektrostatischen 
Maße als Stromeinheit zu wählen; diese heißt dann die elekti'omagnetische 
Stromeinheit, Der Gebrauch derselben hat den Vorteil, daß dann die 



Gleichung (55) die einfache Form H

oder J

annimmt.

wodurch die Messung einer Stromstärke auf die zweier Längen und 
eines Magnetfeldes zurückgeführt ist. Die meisten praktischen Strom- 
meßinstrumente beruhen auf der Ablenkung von Magneten durch Ströme 
oder umgekehrt und liefern daher die Stromstärke im elektromagnetischen 
Maße. Zur Umrechnung auf das zuerst eingeführte elektrostatische Maß 
des Stromes muß dann die Konstante c bekannt sein; dazu genügt aber 
eine einzige Messung. 

Ehe wir von der experimentellen Bestimmung der Größe c sprechen, 
wollen wir uns durch eine einfache Dimensionsbetrachtung über ihre Natur 

informieren. Sie ist nach (55) definiert durch die Formel c = __ _ • 



Nun gelten folgende Dimensionsformeln : 



daher wird die Dimension von c 



>"=[^] 



Nun wissen wir aber, daß elektrische Ladung e und magnetische Pol- 
stärke p von gleicher Dimension sind, weil das Coulombsche Gesetz für 
elektrische und magnetische Kräfte ganz gleich lautet. Daher erhalten wir: 



M = [7]. 



d. h. die Konstante c hat die Dimension einer Geschwindigkeit. 

Ihre erste, exakte Messung ist von Weber und Kohlrausch (1856) 
ausgeführt worden. Diese Versuche gehören zu den denkwürdigsten 
Leistungen physikalischer Präzisionsarbeit, nicht nur wegen ihrer Schwie- 
rigkeit, sondern wegen der Tragweite ihres Resultats. Es ergab sich 
nämlich für c der Wert 3-10^° cm/sec, der genau mit der Lichtgeschwindig- 
keit übereinstimmt. 

Diese Übereinstimmung konnte nicht zufällig sein ; zahlreiche Denker, 
vor allem Weber selbst, sodann die Mathematiker Gauß und Riemann, 
die Physiker Neumann, Kirchhoff, Clausius spürten den tiefen Zu- 
sammenhang, den die Zahl ^ = 3- io^° cm/sec zwischen zwei gewaltigen 
Wissensgebieten herstellte, und sie suchten nach der Brücke, die vom 
Elektromagnetismus nach der Optik führen mußte. Riemann kam der 
Lösung des Problems sehr nahe; erreicht wurde sie aber erst von 
Maxwell, nachdem Faradays wunderbare Experimentierkunst neue Tat- 
sachen und neue Auffassungen gelehrt hatte. Wir wollen jetzt diese 
Entwicklung verfolgen. 

5. Faradays Kraftlinien.

Royal Institution ist bekannt. Ebenso frei vom konventionellen Schema 
wie sein Leben war auch die Welt seiner Gedanken, die unmittelbar und 
ausschließlich aus der Fülle seiner experimentellen Erfahrungen entsprangen. 
Wir haben oben seine Untersuchungen über die elektrolytische Zersetzung 

besprochen. Seine Methode," alle er- 
denklichen Abänderungen der Ver- 
suchsbedingungen vorzunehmen, führte 
ihn (1837) dazu, zwischen die beiden 
Metallplatten (Elektroden) der elektro- 
lytischen Zelle an Stelle einer leitenden 
Flüssigkeit (Säure, Salzlösung) eine 
nichtleitende wie Petroleum, Terpen- 
tin, zu bringen. Diese zersetzen sich 
nicht, aber sie sind doch nicht ohne 
Galvanisches Element Einfluß auf den elektrischen Vorgang. 
Es zeigt sich nämlich, daß die beiden 
Metallplatten, wenn sie durch eine 
bestimmte galvanische Batterie mit bestimmter Spannung geladen werden, 
ganz verschiedene Ladungen aufnehmen, je nach der Substanz, die zwi- 
schen ihnen ist (Abb. 85). Die nichtleitende Substanz beeinflußt also die 
Aufnahmefähigkeit oder Kapazität des aus den beiden Platten bestehenden 
Leitersystems, das man einen Kondensator nennt. 

Diese Entdeckung machte auf Faraday solchen Eindruck, daß er von 
nun an die üblichen Vorstellungen der Elektrostatik von einer unmittel- 
baren Fernwirkung der elektrischen Ladungen aufgab und eine neue, 
eigenartige Deutung der elektrischen und magnetischen Erscheinungen 
entwickelte, die als Nahwirkungstheorie zu -bezeichnen ist. Was er aus dem 
eben geschilderten Experiment lernte, ist die Tatsache, daß die Ladungen 
der beiden Metallplatten nicht einfach durch den dazwischenliegenden 
.Raum aufeinander wirken, sondern, daß das im Zwischenraum befindliche 

Medium eine wesentliche Rolle dabei spielt. 
Daraus schloß er, daß sich die Wirkung durch 
dieses Medium von Stelle zu Stelle fortpflanzt, 
daß es also eine Nahwirkung ist. 

Wir kennen die Nahwirkung der elasti- 
schen Kräfte in deformierten Festkörpern. 
Faraday, der sich immer an empirische Tat- 
sachen hielt, verglich die elektrische Nahwir- 
kung in Nichtleitern zwar mit elastischen 
Spannungen, aber er hielt sich davon fern, die Gesetze dieser auf die 
elektrischen Erscheinungen zu übertragen. Er gebraucht das Bild der 
-»Kraftlinien^^ die in der Richtung der elektrischen Feldstärke von den 
positiven Ladungen durch den Isolator zu den negativen ziehen; im Falle 
eines Plattenkondensators sind die Kraftlinien gerade Linien senkrecht zu 
•den Plattenebenen (Abb. ^d), Faraday betrachtet die Kraftlinien als das 



Abb. 86. 



Faradays Kraftlinien. 129 



eigentliche Substrat der elektrischen Vorgänge, sie sind für ihn geradezu 
materielle Gebilde, die sich bewegen und deformieren und dadurch die 
elektrischen Effekte zustande bringen. Die Ladungen spielen bei Faraday 
eine ganz untergeordnete Rolle, als die Stellen, wo Kraftlinien ausgehen 
oder enden. In dieser Auffassung wurde er durch jene Experimente bestärkt, 
die beweisen, daß auf Leitern die gesamte elektrische Ladung an der 
Oberfläche sitzt, das Innere vollkommen frei bleibt. Um das recht drastisch 
zu zeigen, baute er einen großen, mit Metall ringsum belegten Kasten, 
in den er sich mit empfindlichen elektrischen Meßinstrumenten herein- 
begab; dann ließ er den Kasten aufs stärkste laden und stellte fest, 
daß im Innern nicht der geringste Einfluß der Ladungen wahrzunehmen 
sei. Wir haben oben (V, i, S. 117) gerade diese Tatsache zur Ableitung 
des Coulombschen Fernwirkungsgesetzes benützt. Faraday aber schloß 
daraus, daß die Ladung nicht das Primäre der elektrischen Vorgänge sei 
und daß man sie nicht als Fluidum vorstellen dürfe, das mit Fernkräften 
ausgestattet ist. Sondern das Primäre ist der Spannungszustand des 
elektrischen Feldes in den Nichtleitern, der durch das Bild der Kraftlinien 
dargestellt wird; die Leiter sind gewissermaßen Löcher im elektrischen 
Felde und die Ladungen auf ihnen nur fiktive Begriffe, ersonnen, um die 
durch die Spannungen des Feldes erzeugten Druck- und Zugkräfte als 
Femwirkungen zu erklären. Unter den Nichtleitern oder dielektrischen 
Substanzen ist auch das Vakuum^ der Ather^ der hier wieder in neuem 
Gewände uns entgegentritt. 

Diese fremdartige Auffassung Faradays fand bei den Physikern und 
Mathematikern seiner Zeit zunächst keinen Eingang. Man hielt an der 
Fern Wirkungsauffassung fest, und das ließ sich durchführen auch bei Be- 
rücksichtigung der von Faraday entdeckten »dielektrischen« Wirkung der 
Nichtleiter. Man brauchte nur das Coulombsche Gesetz etwas abzuändern; 
jedem Nichtleiter kommt eine eigentümliche Konstante €, seine > Di- 
elektrizitätskonstante <!-^ zu, die dadurch definiert ist, daß die zwischen 
zwei in dem Nichtleiter eingebetteten Ladungen e^^ e^ wirkende Kraft 
im Verhältnis i : ß kleiner ist als im Vakuum : 

I p e 
(56) - ^= ' " 



£ r" 

Für das Vakuum ist e gleich i, für jeden andern Körper ist € größer als i. 

Mit diesem Ansätze ließen sich nun in der Tat alle Erscheinungen 
der Elektrostatik mit Berücksichtigung der dielektrischen Eigenschaften 
der Nichtleiter erklären. Wir haben bereits oben gesagt, daß die Elektro- 
statik formell schon lange in eine Pseudo-Nahwirkungstheorie, die soge- 
nannte Potentialtheorie, übergegangen war. Diese konnte ebenfalls leicht 
die Dielektrizitätskonstante e assimilieren. Heute wissen wir, daß damit 
eigentlich die mathematische Formulierung des Faradayschen Kraftlinien- 
begriffes schon gewonnen war; aber da diese Potentialmethode nur als 
mathematischer Kunstgriff galt, so blieb der Gegensatz zwischen der 

Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. g

klassischen Fernwirkungstheorie und der Faradayschen Nahwirkungs- 
vorstellung unvermittelt bestehen. 

Ganz analoge Auffassungen entwickelte Faraday für den Magnetismus. 
Er entdeckte, daß auch die Kräfte zwischen zwei Magnetpolen davon 
abhängen, welches Medium sich zwischen ihnen befindet, und er kam 
dadurch wieder zu der Ansicht, daß die magnetischen Kräfte ebenso wie 
die elektrischen durch einen eigenartigen Spannungszustand der Zwischen- 
medien hervorgerufen werden. Zur Darstellung dieser Spannungen dienten 
ihm die Kraftlinien; man kann diese hier geradezu sichtbar machen, 
indem man Eisenfeilspäne auf einen Bogen Papier streut und diesen dicht 
über einen Magneten hält (Abb. 87). 




Die Fernwirkungstheorie führt formal eine der Substanz charakteristische 
Konstante, die magnetische Durchdringbarkeit oder Pentieabilität f,i ein 
und schreibt das Coulombsche Gesetz in der abgeänderten Form: 



'57) 



ä: = 



f.1 r^ 



Man hat sich aber nicht mit diesem formalen Ansätze begnügt, sondern 
einen molekularen Mechanismus ersonnen, der die magnetische und di- 
elektrische Polarisierbarkeit verständlich macht. Wir haben bereits oben 
gesehen, daß die Eigenschaften der Magnete dazu führen, ihre Molekeln 
selbst als kleine Elementarmagnete anzusehen, die beim Prozesse der 
Magnetisierung parallel gerichtet werden. Dabei wird angenommen, daß 
sie von selbst die parallele Einstellung beibehalten, etwa infolge von 
Reibungs wider ständen. Man kann nun annehmen, daß bei den meisten 
Körpern, die nicht als permanente Magnete vorkommen, diese Reibung 
fehlt; dann wird die Parallelstellung zwar durch ein äußeres Magnetfeld 
hergestellt werden, aber sofort verschwinden, wenn das Feld entfernt wird. 
Eine solche Substanz wird also ein Magnet nur so lange sein, als ein 
äußeres Magnetfeld da ist. Man braucht aber gar nicht einmal anzu- 
nehmen, daß die Molekeln permanente Magnete sind, die sich parallel

stellen; wenn jede Molekel die beiden magnetischen Fluida enthält, so 
werden diese sich unter der Wirkung des Feldes scheiden und die Molekel 
wird von selbst ein Magnet. Dieser induzierte Magnetismus aber muß 
genau die Wirkung haben, die die formale Theorie durch Einführung der 
Permeabilität beschreibt. Zwischen zwei Magnetpolen (iV, S] in einem 
solchen Medium bilden sich Ketten von Molekel- 
Magneten, deren entgegengesetzte Pole sich im 
Innern überall kompensieren, aber bei iV^und S 
mit entgegengesetzten Polen endigen und daher 
die Wirkungen von N und S abschwächen 
(Abb. 88). (Es kommt übrigens auch der um- 
gekehrte Effekt der Verstärkung vor; doch gehen 
wir auf dessen Deutung hier nicht ein.) 

Genau dasselbe, was wir hier für den Ma- 
gnetismus erläutert haben, kann man sich nun 
auch für die Elektrizität denken. Ein Dielektri- 
kum besteht danach aus Molekeln, die entweder 
von selbst elektrische Dipole sind und sich in 
einem äußeren Felde parallel richten, oder die 
unter der Wirkung des Feldes durch Scheidung 

der positiven und negativen Elektrizität zu Dipolen werden. Zwischen 
zwei Kondensatorplatten bilden sich dann wieder Ketten von Molekeln 
(Abb. 89), deren Ladungen sich im Innern kompensieren, aber an den 
Platten nicht. Dadurch wird ein Teil der Ladung der Platten selbst auf- 
gehoben, und man muß den Platten neue 
Ladung zuführen, um sie auf eine be- 
stimmte Spannung zu laden. So erklärt 
es sich, daß das polarisierbare Dielektri- 
kum die Aufnahmefähigkeit oder Kapazität 
des Kondensators erhöht. 

Nach dieser Vorstellung der Fernwir- 
kungstheorie ist also die Wirkung des Di- 
elektrikums eine mittelbare. Das Feld im 
Vakuum ist nur eine Abstraktion, es bedeutet die geometrische Verteilung 
der Kraft, die auf einen elektrischen Probekörper von der Ladung i aus- 
geübt würde. Das Feld im Dielektrikum aber besteht in einer wirklichen 
physikalischen Veränderung, der molekularen Verschiebung der Elektrizitäten. 

Die Nahwirkungstheorie Faradays kennt keinen solchen Unterschied 
zwischen dem Felde im Äther und in der isolierenden Materie: beides 
sind Dielektrika; für den Äther ist die Dielektrizitätskonstante e = i^ für 
andere Isolatoren ist sie von i verschieden. Wenn das anschauliche Bild 
der elektrischen Verschiebung für die Materie richtig ist, so muß es auch 
für den Äther gelten. Dieser Gedanke spielt eine große Rolle in der 
Theorie Maxwells, die im Grunde nichts ist als die Übersetzung der 
Faradayschen Kraftlinienvorstellung in die exakte Sprache der Mathematik.

Er nimmt an, daß auch im Äther das Zustandekommen eines elektrischen 
oder magnetischen Feldes von »Verschiebungen« der Fluida begleitet sei. 
Man braucht sich dabei den Äther nicht atomistisch konstituiert zu denken, 
aber der Maxwellsche Gedanke wird doch am klarsten, wenn man sich 
Äthermolekeln vorstellt, die genau wie die materiellen Molekeln im Felde 
zu Dipolen werden. Jedoch das Feld ist nicht die Ursache dieser Polari- 
sation, sondern die Verschiebung ist das Wesen des Spannungszustandes, 
den man elektrisches Feld nennt; die Ketten von Äthermolekeln sind die 
Kraftlinien, und die Ladungen an den Leiteroberflächen sind nichts als 
die End-Ladungen dieser Ketten. Wenn außer den Ätherteilchen auch 
noch materielle Molekeln da sind, so verstärkt sich die Polarisation und 
die Ladungen an den Enden werden größer. 

Sind nun Faradays und Maxwells Vorstellungen richtig, oder die der 
Fern Wirkungstheorie ? 

Solange man sich im Umkreise der elektro- und magneto-statischen Er- 
scheinungen bewegt, sind beide völlig äquivalent. Denn der mathematische 
Ausdruck von Faradays Gedanken ist das, was wir eine Pseudo-Nah- 
wirkungstheorie genannt haben, weil sie zwar mit Differentialgleichungen 
operiert, aber keine endliche Fortpflanzungsgeschwindigkeit der Spannungen 
kennt. Aber Faraday und Maxwell selbst haben diejenigen Vorgänge auf- 
gedeckt, die, analog den Trägheitswirkungen der Mechanik, die Verzöge- 
rung der Übertragung eines elektromagnetischen Zustandes von Stelle zu 
Stelle und damit die endliche Fortpflanzungsgeschwindigkeit bewirken. 
Das sind die magnetische Induktion und der Verschiebungsstrom. 

6. Die magnetische Induktion. 

Nachdem die Erzeugung eines Magnetfeldes durch einen elektrischen 
Strom von Oersted entdeckt, von Biot uud Savart als Fernwirkung for- 
muliert worden war, fand Ampere (1820], daß zwei galvanische Ströme 
aufeinander Kraftwirkungen ausüben, und es gelang ihm wiederum, das 
Gesetz dieser Erscheinung in der Sprache der Fernwirkungstheorie aus- 
zudrücken. Diese Entdeckung hatte weitgehende Konsequenzen, denn 
sie erlaubte, den Magnetismus auf die Elektrizität zurückzuführen. Nach 
Ampere sollen in den Molekeln magnetisierbarer Körper kleine, ge- 
schlossene Ströme fließen; er zeigte, daß solche sich genau wie Elemen- 
tarmagnete verhalten. Dieser Gedanke hat sich durchaus bewährt; von 
jetzt an werden die magnetischen Fluida überflüssig, es gibt nur Elektri- 
zität, die ruhend das elektrostatische, strömend überdies das magnetische 
Feld erzeugt. Die Amp^resche Entdeckung kann man auch so aussprechen: 
Ein vom Strome J^ durchflossener Draht erzeugt nach Oersted in seiner 
Nachbarschaft ein Magnetfeld; ein zweiter Draht, in dem der Strom J^ 
fließt, erfährt dann in diesem Magnetfelde Kraft Wirkungen. Das Magnet- 
feld wirkt also ofi"enbar auf fließende Elektrizität ablenkend oder be- 
schleunigend ein. 



Die magnetische Induktion. 133 



^ A A 



Da liegt nun die Frage nahe: Kann das Magnetfeld nicht auch ruhende 
Elektrizität in Bewegung setzen? Kann es nicht in dem zweiten, ursprüng- 
lich stromlosen Drahte, eine Strömung erzeugen oder »induzieren?« 

Diese Frage hat Faraday (183 1) beantwortet. Er fand, daß ein stati- 
sches Magnetfeld nicht die Fähigkeit hat, einen Strom zu erzeugen ; wohl 
aber entsteht ein Strom, sobald das Magnetfeld sich ändert. Wenn er 
z. B. an einen geschlossenen Leitungsdraht einen Magneten plötzlich an- 
näherte, so floß in dem Drahte ein Strom, solange die Be- 
wegung dauerte; oder wenn er das Magnetfeld durch einen H 
primären Strom erzeugte, so entstand in dem zweiten, 
sekundären Drahte jedesmal ein kurzer Stromimpuls, sobald 
der erste Strom ein- oder ausgeschaltet wurc^e. 

Daraus geht hervor, daß die induzierte elektrische Kraft 
von der zeitlichen Änderungsgeschwindigkeit des Magnet- 
feldes abhängt. Es gelang Faraday, mit Hilfe seiner Kraft- 
linien das quantitative Gesetz der Erscheinung zu formu- 
lieren. Wir wollen diesem eine solche Gestalt geben, daß 
seine Analogie zum Gesetze von Biot und Savart deutlich Abb. 90. 

hervortritt. Wir denken uns ein Bündel paralleler, magneti- 
scher Kraftlinien, die ein magnetisches Feld H bilden ; um diese herum 
denken wir uns einen kreisförmigen Leitungsdraht gelegt (Abb. 90). Wenn 

sich die Feldstärke H in der kleinen Zeit / um ^ ändert, so nennen wir — 

ihre Änderungsgeschwindigkeit oder die Änderung der Kraftlinienzahl. 
Stellen wir die Kraftlinien als Ketten magnetischer Dipole vor (was ja 
eigentlich nach Ampere nicht erlaubt ist), so wird bei der Änderung von H in 
jeder Äthermolekel eine Verschiebung der magnetischen Mengen stattfinden, 
oder ein »magnetischer Verschiebungsstrom«, dessen Stromstärke pro 




Flächeneinheit oder Stromdichte durch y = — gegeben ist. Besteht das 
Feld H nicht im Äther, sondern in einer Substanz von der Permeabilität ^<, 
so ist die Dichte des magnetischen Verschiebungsstromes 7 = ^ — . Durch 
den Querschnitt ^, d. h. die Fläche des vom Leitungsdrahte gebildeten 
Kreises, tritt also der magnetische Strom y = ^y = ^^t — . 

Dieser erzeugt nun nach Faraday ringsherum ein elektrisches Feld E^ 
das den magnetischen Strom genau so umschlingt, wie beim Oerstedschen 
Versuche das magnetische Feld H den elektrischen Strom^ nur in ent- 
gegengesetzter Richtung. Dieses elektrische Feld E ist es, daß den indu- 
zierten Strom in dem Leitungsdrahte antreibt; es ist auch vorhanden, 
wenn gar kein Leitungsdraht da wäre, in dem ein Strom sich ausbilden kann. 

Man sieht, daß die magnetische Induktion Faradays vollständig parallel 
ist zur elektromagnetischen Entdeckung Oersteds. Auch das quantitative

Gesetz ist genau dasselbe. Dort war nach Biot und Savart das von einem 
Stromelement der Länge / und der Stärke J erzeugte Magnetfeld H (vgl.

läßt sich übrigens auf Grund energetischer Betrachtungen einsehen. 

Auf dem Induktionsgesetze beruht ein großer Teil der physikalischen 
und technischen Anwendungen der Elektrizität und des Magnetismus. 
Der Transformator, das Induktorium, die Dynamomaschine und unzählige 
andere Apparate und Maschinen sind Vorrichtungen, um durch wechselnde 
Magnetfelder elektrische Ströme zu induzieren. Aber so interessant diese 
Dinge auch sein mögen, so liegen sie nicht auf unserem Wege, der die 
Erforschung des Äthers im Zusammenhange mit dem Raumproblem zum 
Ziele hat. Wir wenden uns daher sogleich zur Darstellung der Maxwell- 
schen Theorie, deren großes Ziel war, alle bekannten elektromagnetischen 
Erscheinungen zu einer einheitlichen Nahwirkungstheorie im Sinne Faradays 
zusammenzufassen. 



7. Die Nahwirkungstheorie Maxwells. 

Wir haben bereits oben gesagt, daß die Elektro- und Magnetostatik 
bald nach der Aufstellung des Coulombschen Gesetzes von den Mathe- 
matikern in die Gestalt einer Pseudo-Nahwirkungstheorie gebracht wurde. 
Maxwells Aufgabe war es nun, diese durch Verschmelzung mit den Vor- 
stellungen Faradays so auszugestalten, daß sie auch die neuentdeckten 
Erscheinungen der dielektrischen und magnetischen Polarisierbarkeit, des 
Elektromagnetismus und der Magnetinduktion umfaßte. 

Maxwell stellt an die Spitze seiner Lehre die schon oben erwähnte 
Vorstellung, daß ein elektrisches Feld E stets von einer elektrischen Ver- 
schiebung ^E begleitet sei, nicht nur in der Materie, wo £ größer als i 
ist, sondern auch im Äther, wo € = i ist. Wir haben oben dargelegt, 




Die Nahwirkungstheorie Maxwells. I^c 

wie man sich diese Verschiebung durch Trennung und Strömung der 
elektrischen Fluida in den Molekeln anschaulich machen kann. 

Das erste, was Maxwell nun feststellt, ist die Tatsache, daß auf Grund 
der Verschiebungsvorstellung das Coulombsche Gesetz im Grunde nichts 
ist, als eine Folgerung des Satzes von der Unzerstörbarkeit der Elektrizität. 

Wir denken uns eine Metallkugel in 
einem Medium der Dielektrizitätskonstante 
e eingebettet (Abb. 92). In diesem kon- 
struieren wir eine Kugel vom Radius i 
und eine zweite vom Radius r. Jetzt 
werde die Metallkugel mit der Elektrizitäts- 
menge + ^ geladen. Nach Maxwell muß 
dann in jeder Molekel des Dielektrikums 
eine Verschiebung der positiven Elektrizität 
nach außen erfolgen, damit die in einem be- 
liebigen Volumen enthaltene Elektrizitäts- 
menge konstant bleibt. Nun soll die Menge 
der durch die Oberfläche einer Kugef vom Abb. 92. 

Radius i verschobenen Elektrizität nach 

Maxwell durch eE gemessen werden. Durch jede konzentrische Kugel 
wird dieselbe Elektrizitätsmenge durchtreten, weil ja sonst im Dielektri- 
kum eine Anhäufung von Ladungen eintreten würde. Da sich nun die 
Oberflächen zweier Kugeln verhalten wie die Quadrate der Radien, so 
tritt durch die Kugel vom Radius r die Elektrizitätsmenge r^ eE hindurch. 

Diese muß nun auch genau gleich der Ladung e der Metallkugel sein, 
an der die Verschiebung ihr Ende findet; also gilt r^eE = e^ oder: 

er 

Das ist aber das Coulombsche Gesetz in der verallgemeinerten Form (56), 
S. 129.; E ist die von der Ladung e auf die Einheitsladung im Abstände r 
ausgeübte Kraft. 

Handelt es sich nicht um Kugeln, sondern um beliebige, geladene 
Körper, so bleibt doch der Grundgedanke Maxwells derselbe: Das Feld 
ist durch die Bedingung bestimmt, daß die Verschiebung e E der Elek- 
trizität im Dielektrikum nach außen oder die »Divergenz« von e E (div 
eE) durch irgendeine beliebig kleine geschlossene Fläche gerade die im 
Innern der Fläche auftretenden Ladungen kompensiert. Indem wir die 
Ladung pro Volumeneinheit oder Ladimgsdichte der Elektrizität mit q 
bezeichnen, schreiben wir symbolisch 

(58) div £^= q. 

Dies soll uns nur eine Gedächtnishilfe für das eben formulierte Gesetz 
sein. Maxwell aber zeigte, daß man für den Begriff" der Divergenz einen 
bestimmten Differentialausdruck ableiten kann ; daher bedeutet die Formel (5 8) 
dem Mathematiker eine Differentialgleichung, ein Nahwirkungsgesetz. 



136 



Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 



Genau dieselben Überlegungen gelten für den Magnetismus mit 
einem wichtigen Unterschiede: nach Ampere soll es gar keine eigent- 
lichen Magnete, keine magnetischen Mengen geben, sondern nur Elektro- 
magnete. Das magnetische Feld soll immer durch elektrische Ströme 
erzeugt sein, sei es durch Leitungsströme in Drähten, sei es durch mole- 
kulare Ströme in den Molekeln. Daraus folgt, daß die magnetischen 
Kraftlinien niemals endigen, also entweder in sich zurücklaufen oder 
sich ins Unendliche verlieren. Bei einem Elektromagneten, einer strom- 
durchflossenen Spule (Abb. 93), ist das der Fall; die magnetischen Kraft- 
linien gehen geradlinig durch das Innere der Spule, zum Teil schließen 
sie sich außen, zum Teil verlaufen sie ins Unendliche. Denkt man sich 
die Spule durch zwei Ebenen A, B abgeschlossen, so wird gerade so viel 
»magnetische Verschiebung« ^i ZT durch ^ eintreten, wie durch B aus- 



\ \ \ \A

tritt; übrigens sagt man, da hier das Verschiebungsbild schlecht paßt, 
statt Verschiebung gewöhnlich »magnetische Induktion«. Durch irgend- 
eine geschlossene Fläche werden immer ebenso viele Kraftlinien ein- wie 
austreten; oder, die gesamte »Divergenz« des Magnetismus durch eine 
beliebisre sreschlossene Fläche ist Null: 



(59) 



div u H = o. 



Das ist die Maxwellsche Nahwirkungsformel des Magnetismus. 

Wir kommen jetzt zum Biot-Savartschen Gesetze des Elektromagnetismus. 
Um dieses in ein Nahwirkungsgesetz zu verwandeln, denken wir uns den 
elektrischen Strom nicht in einem dünnen Drahte, sondern gleichförmig 

/ 



mit der Dichte i 



über einen kreisförmigen Querschnitt q verteilt 



und fragen nach der magnetischen Feldstärke H am Rande des Quer- 
schnitts (Abb. 94). Dann ist diese nach Biot und Savart überall in der 
Richtung der Tangente an den Kreis und hat nach Formel (55), S. 126, 



Der Verschiebungsstrom, 



137 



den Betrag Zr= ^^, wo r der Radius des Kreises, / die Länge des 
Stromelements ist. Nun ist der Querschnitt, die Kreisfläche, gleich Trr^, 

YJ' T* TT 

also kann man die Formel (55) schreiben — y = -^^ = ^z=z und 

^^^' 7il Ttr q ' 

das gilt für beliebig kleinen Querschnitt und für beliebig kleine Länge /. 
Links steht also eine gewisse Differentialgröße des Magnetfeldes, und das 
Gesetz besagt, daß diese der Stromdichte proportional ist. Die genaue 
mathematische Untersuchung dieser Differentialbildung können wir hier 
nicht durchführen; sie muß nicht nur die Größe, sondern auch die Rich- 
tung des Magnetfeldes berücksichtigen, und da dieses sich rotatorisch um 
die Stromrichtung herumwindet, heißt die Differentialoperation > Rotation« 
des Feldes H (rot ZT). Daher schreiben wir symbolisch 

(60) c TOtH = i 

und fassen diese Formel wieder nur als Gedächtnishilfe auf für den Zu- 
sammenhang von Richtung und Größe des Magnetfeldes H mit der 
Stromdichte i. Für den Mathematiker aber ist es eine Differentialgleichung 
von ähnlicher Art, wie das Gesetz (58). 

Ganz genau dasselbe gilt nun für die Magnetinduktion, nur wollen 
wir das entgegengesetzte Vorzeichen schreiben, um den umgekehrten Dreh- 
sinn anzudeuten: 

(61) ^rot^ = — j , 

Die vier symbolischen Formeln (58) bis (61) haben eine wunderbare 
Symmetrie. Eine solche formale Schönheit ist keineswegs gleichgültig; sie 
enthüllt die Einfachheit des Naturgeschehens, das durch die Begrenztheit 
unserer Sinne der direkten Anschauung verborgen bleibt und sich nur 
dem zergliedernden Verstände offenbart. 

8. Der Verschiebungsstrom. 

Diese Symmetrie ist aber noch nicht vollkommen; denn i bedeutet 
die Dichte des elektrischen Leitungsstromes, also einen Transport elek- 
trischer Ladungen über endliche Entfernungen, / aber ist die zeitliche 
Änderung des Magnetfeldes und läßt sich nur auf Grund der recht künst- 
lichen Hypothese der Ätherdipole als Verschiebungsstrom deuten. 

Maxwell bemerkte nun (1864), daß, was dem magnetischen Felde 
recht, dem elektrischen billig sei. Die Vorstellung der Dipole zwingt 
dazu, auch einen dielektrischen Verschiebungsstrom anzunehmen, der in 
Nichtleitern fließt, wenn das elektrische Feld E sich ändert; ist e die 
Änderung von E in der Zeit /, so ist die Dichte des dielektrischen Ver- 

t 

Schiebungsstroms gleich e — zu setzen. 

Diese Maxwellsche Theorie, die in unserer Darstellung fast trivial an- 
mutet, ist von größter Bedeutung, denn sie wurde der Schlüssel zur 



138 



Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 



elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie. Wir wollen uns ihren Sinn an einem 
konkreten Falle klar machen. Die Pole einer galvanischen Zelle seien 
durch zwei Drähte mit den Platten eines Kondensators verbunden; in 
einer der beiden Drahtverbindungen sei ein Stromschlüssel (Abb. 95). 
Schließt man diesen, so fließt ein kurzer Strom, der die beiden Konden- 
satorplatten auflädt; dabei entsteht zwischen diesen ein elektrisches Feld E. 

Vor Maxwell faßte man diesen 
Vorgang als »offenen Strom« auf; 
Maxwell aber sagt, daß während 
des Anwachsens des Feldes E 
zwischen den Kondensatorplatten 
ein Verschiebungsstrom fließt, der 
den Leitungsstrom zu einem ge- 
schlossenen ergänzt. Sobald die 
Kondensatorplatten aufgeladen 
sind, hören beide Ströme, Lei- 
tungs- und Verschiebungsstrom, 
auf. 

Das wesentliche ist nun, daß 
Maxwell behauptet, der Verschie- 
bungsstrom erzeuge genau so, 
wie der Leitungsstrom, ein Magnetfeld nach dem Biot-Savartschen 
Gesetze. Daß das wirklich so ist, haben nicht nur die Erfolge der 
Maxwellschen Theorie durch richtige Vorhersage zahlreicher Erschei- 
nungen bewiesen, sondern es ist später auch direkt experimentell be- 
stätigt worden. 

In einem Halbleiter werden Leitungs- und Verschiebungsstrom zugleich 
vorhanden sein. Für den ersteren gilt das Ohmsche Gesetz (53), S. 125, 

£ C

gleich, da sind, wird also i 



£ h oE sein. 



Für den Magnetismus 



gibt es aber keinen Leitungsstrom, es ist immer / = f,i 



^ 



Setzt man 



das in unsere symbolischen Gleichungen (58) bis (61) ein, so lauten sie: 



{62) 



a) div £ E = Q, c) cxotH — e — = G E^ 



b) divi-iH = Oj d) crotE-\-!,L 



Das sind die Maocwellschen Gesetze^ die die Grundlage aller elektroma- 
gnetischen und optischen Theorien bis auf unsere Zeit geblieben sind. 
Für den Mathematiker sind sie ganz bestimmte Differentialgleichungen. 
Uns sind sie kurze Gedächtnisregeln, die besagen: 



Die elektromagnetische Lichttheorie. I^Q 

a) Wo elektrische Ladung auftritt, entsteht ein elektrisches Feld von 
solcher Art, daß in jedem Volumen die Ladung durch die Ver- 
schiebung gerade kompensiert wird. 

b) Durch jede geschlossene Fläche tritt ebensoviel magnetische Ver- 
schiebung ein wie aus. 

c) Um einen elektrischen Strom, sei es Leitungs- oder Verschiebungs- 
strom, windet sich ein magnetisches Feld. 

d) Um einen magnetischen Verschiebungsstrom windet sich ein elek- 
trisches Feld im umgekehrten Sinne. 

Die Maxwellschen -» Feldgleichungen* ^ wie man sie nennt, sind eine 
echte Nah Wirkungstheorie; denn sie liefern, wie wir sogleich sehen wer- 
den, eine endliche Fortpflanzungsgeschwindigkeit der elektromagnetischen 
Kräfte. 

Zur Zeit, da sie aufgestellt wurden, war aber der Glaube an unmittel- 
bare Fernwirkung nach dem Schema der Newtonschen Attraktion noch 
so eingewurzelt, daß es eine beträchtliche Zeit dauerte, bis sie sich durch- 
setzen konnten. Denn auch die Fernwirkungstheorie hatte es verstanden, 
die Induktionserscheinungen mit Formeln zu meistern. Dazu mußte man 
annehmen, daß bewegte Ladungen außer der Coulombschen Anziehung 
noch besondere Fernwirkungen ausüben, die von der Größe und Richtung 
der Geschwindigkeit abhängen. Die ersten Ansätze dieser Art stammen 
von Neumann (1845). Besonders berühmt ist das Gesetz, das Wil- 
helm Weber (1846) aufgestellt hat; ähnliche Formeln haben Riemann 
(1858) und Clausius (1877) angegeben. Alle diese Theorien haben 
gemeinsam, daß sämtliche elektrischen und magnetischen Wirkungen durch 
Kräfte zwischen elektrischen Elementarladungen oder, wie man heute 
sagt, »Elektronen« erklärt werden sollen; es handelt sich also um Vor- 
läufer der heutigen Elektronentheorie, wobei allerdings ein wesentlicher 
Umstand noch fehlt: die endliche Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeit der Kräfte. 
Diese Fernwirkungstheorien der Elektrodynamik lieferten eine vollständige 
Erklärung der bei geschlossenen Leitungsströmen auftretenden bewegenden 
Kräfte und Induktionsströme. Aber bei »offenen« Leitungen, d. h. Kon- 
densatorladungen und -entladungen, mußten sie versagen; denn dabei 
kommt der Verschiebungsstrom ins Spiel, von dem die Fernwirkungs- 
theorien nichts wissen. He Im hol tz hat sich besonders darum verdient 
gemacht, durch geeignete Versuchsanordnungen eine Entscheidung zwischen 
der Fern- und der Nahwirkungstheorie herbeizuführen. Das ist ihm auch 
bis zu einem gewissen Grade gelungen, und er selber wurde einer der 
eifrigsten Vorkämpfer der Maxwellschen Theorie. Aber erst sein Schüler 
Hertz verhalf ihr durch die Entdeckung der elektromagnetischen Wellen 
zum Siege. 

9. Die elektromagnetische Lichttheorie. 

Wir haben schon oben (V, 4, S. 127) von dem Eindruck gesprochen, den 
die von Weber und Kohlrausch festgestellte Übereinstimmung der elektro- 



IAO I^i^ Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

magnetischen Konstanten c mit der Lichtgeschwindigkeit auf die Forscher 
jener Zeit machte. Es gab aber noch andere Hinweise dafür, daß eine enge 
Beziehung zwischen dem Licht und den elektromagnetischen Vorgängen 
bestehen müsse. Am eindringlichsten zeigt das die Entdeckung Fara- 
days (1834), daß ein polarisierter Lichtstrahl, der einen magnetisierten 
Körper passiert, von diesem beeinflußt wird; wenn der Strahl parallel 
zu den magnetischen Kraftlinien verläuft, wird seine Polarisationsebene 
gedreht. Faraday selbst schloß daraus, daß der Lichtäther und der 
Träger der elektromagnetischen Kraftlinien identisch sein müßten. Ob- 
wohl er nicht Mathematiker genug war, um seine Vorstellungen in quan- 
titative Gesetze und Formeln umzusetzen, so war doch seine Gedanken- 
welt von der abstraktesten Art und nicht im geringsten an die engen 
Schranken der trivialen Anschauung gebunden, die das Gewohnte für das 
Bekannte nimmt. Faradays Äther war kein elastisches Medium, er bekam 
seine Eigenschaften nicht aus Analogien der scheinbar bekannten mate- 
riellen Welt, sondern aus exakten Experimenten und den daraus ent- 
springenden, wirklich bekannten Zusammenhängen. Maxwell hat Faradays 
Werk fortgesetzt; seine Begabung war der Faradays ähnlich, dazu kam 
aber eine vollkommene Beherrschung der mathematischen Hilfsmittel 
seiner Zeit. 

Wir wollen uns jetzt klar machen, daß aus Maxwells Feldgesetzen {62) 
die Fortpflanzung elektromagnetischer Kräfte mit endlicher Geschwindig- 
keit hervorgeht. Dabei beschränken wir uns auf Vorgänge im Vakuum 
oder Äther; dieser hat keine Leitfähigkeit, a = o, keine wahren Ladungen, 
^ = o, und seine Dielektrizitätskonstante und Permeabilität sind gleich i, 
€ = I, ^ == I. Dann besagen die beiden ersten Feldgleichungen (62) 

{6'^ divjE=o, divZr=o, 

daß alle Kraftlinien geschlossen sind oder ins Unendliche verlaufen. Wir 
wollen, um ein wenn auch rohes Bild der Vorgänge zu erhalten, uns 
einzelne, geschlossene Kraftlinien vorstellen. 

Die beiden andern Feldgleichungen lauten dann: 

e \\ 

(64) — = ^ rot ZT, — = — ^ rot ^ . 

Nun nehmen wir an, daß irgendwo in einem begrenzten Räume ein elek- 
trisches Feld E herrscht, das sich in der kleinen Zeit / um e ändert; 

c . .. 

dann ist — seine Änderungsgeschwindigkeit. Nach der ersten Gleichung 

schlingt sich um dieses Feld sogleich ein Magnetfeld, das der Änderungs- 

e 
geschwindigkeit — proportional ist; auch dieses wird sich zeitlich ändern, 

während eines folgenden kleinen Zeitabschnittes i um 1^. Seine Änderungs- 

geschwmdigkeit — induziert sogleich nach der zweiten Gleichung em um- 




Die elektromagnetische Lichttheorie. iai 

schlingendes elektrisches Feld. Im nächsten kleinen Zeitabschnitt erzeugt 
dieses wieder nach der ersten Gleichung ein umschlingendes Magnetfeld, 
und so setzt sich der Prozeß 

kettenartig mit endlicher Ge- £ ^-<^ ^— «C ^-<:£ 

schwindigkeit fort (Abb. 96). 

Natürlich ist das nur eine 
sehr rohe Beschreibung des in 
Wirklichkeit kontinuierlichen, Abb. 96. 

nach allen Seiten sich aus- 
breitenden Vorganges; wir werden nachher ein besseres Bild entwerfen. 

Was uns hier besonders interessiert ist dies: Wir wissen aus der 
Mechanik, daß das Zustandekommen einer endlichen Fortpflanzungs- 
geschwindigkeit elastischer Wellen auf den Verzögerungen beruht, die 
infolge der Massenträgheit bei der Weitergabe der Kräfte von Punkt zu 
Punkt des Körpers eintreten. Die Massenträgheit aber wird durch die 
Beschleunigung bestimmt, und diese ist die Änderungsgeschwindigkeit der 

w . - . . 

Geschwindigkeit; es ist d = — , wo w die Änderung der Geschwindig- 

X ... 

keit V = — in der kleinen Zeit / ist. Die Verzögerung beruht also 

durchaus auf der zweifachen Differentiation. 

Genau dasselbe ist nun hier der Fall; zunächst bestimmt die Ände- 

rungsgeschwindigkeit des elektrischen Feldes — das Magnetfeld H^ dann 

. . . fi 
dessen Anderungsgeschwindigkeit — das elektrische Feld E an einer Nach- 

barstelle. Das Fortschreiten des elektrischen Feldes für sich von Stelle 
zu Stelle wird somit durch zwei zeitliche Differentiationen bedingt, also 
durch eine der Beschleunigung ganz analoge Bildung. Hierauf allein beruht 
die Existenz elektromagnetischer Wellen. Würde eine der beiden Teil- 
wirkungen zeitlos verlaufen, so würde keine wellenartige Ausbreitung der 
elektrischen Kraft zustande kommen. Hier sieht man die Wichtigkeit 
des Maxwellschen Verschiebungsstroms, denn dieser ist gerade die Ände- 

e 

rungsgeschwindigkeit — des elektrischen Feldes. 

Wir geben nun noch ein Bild der Fortpflanzung einer elektromagne- 
tischen Welle, das der Wirklichkeit etwas näher kommt. Zwei Metall- 
kugeln mögen starke, entgegengesetzt gleiche Ladungen -\- e und — e 
tragen, so daß ein starkes elektrisches Feld zwischen ihnen besteht. Nun 
möge ein Funke zwischen den Kugeln überschlagen; dann gleichen sich 
die Ladungen aus, das Feld bricht zusammen mit großer Änderungs- 

e 

geschwmdigkeit y • Die Figur zeigt, wie sich dann abwechselnd magne- 

tische und elektrische Kraftlinien umeinander schlingen (Abb. 97); dabei 



142 Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 




sind die magnetischen Kraftlinien nur in der Mittelebene zwischen den 
Kugeln, die elektrischen in der darauf senkrechten Papierebene gezeichnet; 
die ganze Figur ist natürlich rotationssymmetrisch um die Verbindungslinie 

der Kugeln zu denken. Jede 
folgende Kraftlinienschlinge ist 
schwächer als die vorhergehende, 
weil sie weiter nach außen liegt 
und einen größeren Umfang hat ; 
daher hebt der innere Teil einer 
Schlinge elektrischer Kraft den 
äußeren Teil der vorhergehenden 
nicht ganz auf, zumal er etwas 
verspätet in Wirksamkeit tritt. 
Verfolgt man den Vorgang 
Abb. 97. längs einer Geraden, die auf der 

Verbindungslinie der Kugelmit- 
ten senkrecht steht, etwa längs der :v- Achse, so sieht man, daß auf 
dieser die elektrischen und magnetischen Kräfte immer senkrecht stehen; 
überdies stehen sie aufeinander senkrecht. Dasselbe gilt übrigens für 
jede Fortpflanzungsrichtung. Die elektromagnetische Welle ist also streng 
transversal; ferner ist sie polarisiert, doch hat man noch die Wahl, ob 
man die elektrische oder die magnetische Feldstärke als maßgebend für 
die Schwingung ansehen will. 

Daß die Geschwindigkeit der Fortpflanzung gerade gleich der in den 
Formeln vorkommenden Konstanten c wird, können wir hier nicht be- 
weisen; es ist aber wohl an sich plausibel, denn wir wissen, daß c die 
Dimension einer Geschwindigkeit hat. Da ferner nach Weber und 
Kohlrausch die Größe von c gleich der Lichtgeschwindigkeit ist, so durfte 
Maxwell schließen, daß die Lichtwellen nichts seien als elektromagnetische 
Wellen. 

Von den Folgerungen, die Maxwell zog, wurde eine bald in gewissem 
Umfange experimentell bestätigt. Er berechnete nämlich die Lichtge- 
schwindigkeit c^ in einem nicht merklich magnetisierbaren Nichtleiter 
(|tt = I, (T = o); diese kann dann außer von c nur noch von der Di- 
elektrizitätskonstante E abhängen, denn diese ist für ^t == i, c == o die 
einzige in den Formeln (62) vorkommende Konstante. Maxwell fand 

c . . c I— 

c^ = — — ; daraus ergibt sich für den Brechungsindex n = — = yg. 

Vs ^i 

Man müßte also die Brechbarkeit des Lichtes durch die aus rein 
elektrischen Messungen bekannte Dielektrizitätskonstante bestimmen können. 
Für einige Gase, z. B. Wasserstoff, Kohlenoxyd, Luft, ist das auch tat- 
sächlich der Fall, wie L. Boltzmann (1874) gezeigt hat; für andere 
Substanzen ist die Maxwellsche Relation n == Ve nicht richtig, dann 
ist aber jedesmal der Brechungsindex nicht konstant, sondern von der 



Die elektromagnetische Lichttheorie. 14^2 

Farbe (Schwingungszahl) des Lichtes abhängig. Hier tritt also die Farben- 
zerstreuung oder Dispersion des Lichtes störend dazwischen; wir werden 
auf diese nachher vom Standpunkte der Elektronentheorie zurückkommen. 
Jedenfalls ist klar, daß die statisch gemessene Dielektrizitätskonstante um 
so besser mit dem Quadrate des Brechungsindex stimmen wird, je lang- 
samer die Schwingungen, oder je länger die Wellen des benutzten Lichtes 
sind; unendlich langsame Schwingungen sind ja mit einem statischen 
Zustande identisch. Die neuere Erforschung des langwelligsten Gebietes 
der Licht- und Wärmestrahlen durch Rubens hat eine vollständige Be- 
stätigung der Maxwellschen Formel gebracht. 

Was nun die mehr geometrischen Gesetze der Optik anbelangt, Re- 
flexion und Brechung, Doppelbrechung und Polarisation in Kristallen usw., 
so verschwinden in der elektromagnetischen Lichttheorie alle die Schwierig- 
keiten, die für die Theorien vom elastischen Äther schier unüberwindlich 
waren. Dort war es vor allem die Existenz longitudinaler Wellen, die 
beim Durchgang des Lichtes durch die Grenzfläche zwischen zwei Medien 
zum Vorschein kamen und nur durch ganz unwahrscheinliche Hypothesen 
über die Konstitution des Äthers beseitigt werden konnten. Die elektro- 
magnetischen Wellen sind immer streng transversal. Damit fällt diese 
Schwierigkeit fort. Formal ist die Maxwellsche Theorie mit der Äther- 
theorie von Mac CuUagh nahezu identisch, die wir oben (IV, 6, S. 91) 
erwähnt haben; man kann ohne neue Rechnung die meisten Folgerungen 
übertragen. 

Wir können auf die weitere Entwicklung der Elektrodynamik nicht 
näher eingehen. Das Band zwischen Licht und Elektromagnetismus 
wurde immer enger. Immer mehr Erscheinungen wurden entdeckt, die 
einen Einfluß elektrischer und magnetischer Felder auf das Licht anzeigten. 
Alles fügte sich den Maxwellschen Gesetzen, deren Sicherheit ständig 
wuchs. 

Aber den schlagenden Beweis für die Einheit der Optik mit der 
Elektrodynamik erbrachte Heinrich Hertz (1888), indem er die endliche 
Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeit der elektromagnetischen Kraft nachwies und 
elektromagnetische Wellen wirklich herstellte. Er ließ zwischen zwei ge- 
ladenen Kugeln Funken überspringen und erzeugte dadurch Wellen, wie sie 
unsere Abbildung (Abb. 97) darstellt. Wenn sie auf einen kreisförmigen 
Draht trafen, der eine kleine Lücke hatte, so riefen sie in diesem Ströme 
hervor, die durch kleine Fünkchen an der Lücke beobachtet werden 
konnten. Es gelang Hertz diese Wellen zu spiegeln und zur Interferenz 
zu bringen; dadurch konnte er ihre Wellenlänge messen und ihre Ge- 
schwindigkeit berechnen, die sich genau gleich der des Lichtes c ergab. 
Damit war Maxwells Hypothese unmittelbar bestätigt. Heute laufen die 
Hertzschen Wellen der großen Stationen für drahtlose Telegraphie ständig 
über die Erde und legen Zeugnis ab für die beiden großen Forscher 
Maxwell und Hertz, von denen der eine ihre Existenz vorhergesagt, der 
andere sie wirklich hergestellt hat. 



144 ^^^ Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

10. Der elektromagnetische Äther. 

Von nun an gibt es nur noch einen Äther als Träger der Gesamtheit 
aller elektrischen, magnetischen, optischen Erscheinungen. Wir kennen 
seine Gesetze, Maxwells Feldgleichungen, aber wir wissen wenig über 
seine Konstitution. Was ist es eigentlich, worin die elektromagnetischen 
Felder bestehen und was in den Lichtwellen Schwingungen ausführt? 

Wir erinnern uns, daß Maxwell den Begriff der Verschiebung seinen 
Betrachtungen zugrunde gelegt hat, und wir haben diesen anschaulich so 
gedeutet, daß in den kleinsten Teilen oder Molekeln des Äthers gerade 
so wie in den Molekeln der Materie eine wirkliche Verschiebung und 
Scheidung der elektrischen (oder magnetischen) Fluida eintritt. Diese 
Vorstellung ist, soweit sie den Vorgang der elektrischen Polarisation der 
Materie anbetrifft, sehr gut begründet und wird auch von der neueren 
Ausgestaltung der Maxwellschen Lehre, der Elektronentheorie, über- 
nommen; denn daß die Materie molekular konstituiert ist, und daß jede 
Molekel verschiebbare Ladungen trägt, ist durch zahllose Erfahrungen 
sichergestellt. Aber für den freien Äther ist das keineswegs so; hier ist 
der Maxvvellsche Begriff der Verschiebung rein hypothetisch und hat nur 
den Wert, die abstrakten Gesetze des Feldes zu veranschaulichen. 

Diese Gesetze besagen, daß mit jeder zeitlich veränderlichen Ver- 
schiebung die Entstehung eines elektromagnetischen Kraftfeldes rings- 
umher verknüpft ist. Kann man sich von diesem Zusammenhange ein 
mechanisches Bild machen? 

Maxwell selbst hat mechanische Modelle für die Konstitution des 
Äthers angegeben und sie heuristisch erfolgreich verwendet. Besonders 
erfinderisch in dieser Richtung war William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), 
der unablässig bemüht war, die elektromagnetischen Erscheinungen als 
Wirkungen verborgener mechanischer Bewegungen und Kräfte zu ver- 
stehen. 

Der rotatorische Charakter des Zusammenhanges zwischen elektrischem 
Strom und magnetischem Felde und umgekehrt legt es nahe, den elek- 
trischen Zustand des Äthers als lineare Verschiebung, den magnetischen 
als Drehung um eine Achse aufzufassen, oder umgekehrt. 

Man kommt so auf Vorstellungen, die Mac CuUaghs Äthertheorie ver- 
wandt sind; bei dieser sollte der Äther nicht elastische Widerstände gegen 
Verzerrungen im gewöhnlichen Sinne entwickeln, sondern Widerstände 
gegen die absolute Rotation seiner Volumenelemente. Es würde uns viel 
zu weit führen, die zahlreichen, oft sehr phantastischen Hypothesen über 
die Konstitution des Äthers aufzuzählen. 

Wollte man sie wörtlich nehmen, so wäre der Äther eine fürchter- 
liche Maschinerie von unsichtbaren Zahnrädern, Kreiseln und Getrieben, 
die in der verwickeltsten Weise ineinandergreifen, und von all dem Wust 
wäre nichts zu merken als einige relativ einfache Kräfte, die als elektro- 
magnetisches Feld in Erscheinung treten. 



Der elektromagnetische Äther. iac 

Es gibt auch feinere, oft sehr geistreiche Theorien, bei denen der 
Äther eine Flüssigkeit ist, deren Strömungsgeschwindigkeit etwa das 
elektrische, deren Wirbel das magnetische Feld darstellen. Bjerknes hat 
eine Theorie entworfen, bei der die elektrischen Ladungen als pulsierende 
Kugeln in der Ätherflüssigkeit vorgestellt werden, und er hat gezeigt, daß 
solche Kugeln Kräfte aufeinander ausüben, die mit den elektromagne- 
tischen eine beträchtliche Ähnlichkeit zeigen. 

Fragen wir nun nach dem Sinn und Wert solcher Theorien, so ist zu 
ihren Gunsten anzuführen, daß sie, wenn auch selten genug, zu neuen 
Experimenten und zur Entdeckung neuer Erscheinungen angeregt haben. 
Noch öfters allerdings sind große und mühevolle Experimentalforschungen 
angestellt worden, um zwischen zwei Äthertheorien zu entscheiden, die 
beide gleich unwahrscheinlich und phantastisch waren; auf diese Weise 
ist viel Arbeit sinnlos aufgewendet worden. Auch heute noch gibt es 
einige Leute, die die mechanische Erklärung des elektromagnetischen 
Äthers für eine Forderung der Vernunft ansehen; immer wieder tauchen 
solche Theorien auf, die naturgemäß immer abstruser werden, da die 
Fülle der zu erklärenden Tatsachen und damit die Schwierigkeit der Auf- 
gabe dauernd wächst. 

Heinrich Hertz hat sich von allen mechanistischen Spekulationen 
bewußt abgewandt. Wir zitieren seine Worte: »Das Innere aller Körper, 
den freien Äther eingeschlossen, kann von der Ruhe aus Störungen er- 
fahren, welche wir als elektrische, und andere Störungen, welche wir als 
magnetische bezeichnen. Das Wesen dieser Zustandsänderungen kennen 
wir nicht, sondern nur die Erscheinungen, welche ihr Vorhandensein her- 
vorruft.« Dieser klare Verzicht auf mechanische Erklärung ist methodisch 
von größter Wichtigkeit. Er öffnet den Weg für die großen Fortschritte, 
die durch Einsteins Arbeiten erreicht worden sind. Die mechanischen 
Eigenschaften fester und flüssiger Körper sind uns aus Erfahrung be- 
kannt; aber diese Erfahrur.g betrifft nur ihr Verhalten im Groben. Es 
kann wohl sein und wird durch die neuere Molekularforschung bekräftigt, 
daß diese sichtbaren, groben Eigenschaften eine Art Schein sind, vor- 
getäuscht durch die Plumpheit der Beobachtungsmethoden, während die 
tatsächlichen Vorgänge zwischen den kleinsten Bausteinen, den Atomen, 
Molekeln und Elektronen, nach ganz andern Gesetzen vor sich gehen. 
Darum ist es ein naives Vorurteil, jedes kontinuierliche Medium wie der 
Äther müßte sich verhalten, wie die scheinbar kontinuierlichen Flüssig-

Die Eigenschaften des Äthers müssen durch das Studium der in ihm 
ablaufenden Vorgänge unabhängig von allen sonstigen Erfahrungen fest- 
gestellt werden. Das Resultat dieser Forschungen kann man so aus- 
sprechen: Der Zustand des Äthers läßt sich durch zwei gerichtete Größen 
beschreiben, die die Namen elektrische und magnetische Feldstärke, E und 
Ilj führen und deren räumliche und zeitliche Änderungen durch die 
Maxwellschen Gleichungen verknüpft sind; unter gewissen Umständen sind

durch den Ätherzustand mechanische, thermische, chemische Wirkungen 
auf die Materie bedingt, die zur Beobachtung gelangen können. 

Alles, was über diese Aussagen hinausgeht, ist überflüssige Hypothese, 
Phantasie. Man kann einwenden, daß eine solche abstrakte Auffassung 
die Erfindungskraft des Forschers unterbindet, die durch anschauliche 
Bilder und Analogien angeregt wird. Aber das Beispiel von Hertz selbst 
widerlegt diese Meinung, denn selten war einem Physiker eine solche 
experimentelle Gestaltungskraft eigen wie ihm, der als Theoretiker nur 
die reinste Abstraktion gelten ließ. 



II. Hertz' Theorie der bewegten Körper. 

Wichtiger als das Scheinproblem der mechanischen Deutung der Äther- 
vorgänge ist die Frage nach dem Einflüsse der Bewegungen der Körper, 
zu denen auch der Äther außerhalb der Materie zu rechnen ist, auf die 
elektromagnetischen Erscheinungen. Wir kommen damit von einem 
allgemeineren Standpunkte zu den Untersuchungen zurück, die wir früher 
(IV, 7 — ii) über die Optik bewegter Körper angestellt haben. Die 
Optik ist jetzt ein Teilgebiet der Elektrodynamik, der Lichtäther mit dem 
elektromagnetischen Äther identisch. Alle Schlüsse, die wir dort aus den 
optischen Beobachtungen auf das Verhalten des Lichtäthers gezogen haben, 
müssen ihre Geltung behalten, da sie offenbar von dem Mechanismus der 
Lichtschwingungen ganz unabhängig sind; unsere Untersuchung betraf ja 
nur die geometrischen Merkmale einer Lichtwelle: Schwingungszahl 
(Dopplerscher Effekt), Geschwindigkeit (Mitführung) und Fortpflanzungs- 
richtung (Aberration). 

Wir haben gesehen, daß bis zur Zeit der Entwicklung der elektro- 

V 

magnetischen Lichttheorie nur Größen i. Ordnung bezüghch p = — 

der Messung zugänglich waren. Und das Resultat dieser Beobachtungen 
ließ sich kurz als das »optische Relativitätsprinzip« so aussprechen: Die 
optischen Vorgänge hängen nur von den relativen Bewegungen der be- 
teiligten, Licht aussendenden, übermittelnden, empfangenden materiellen 
Körper ab; in einem translatorisch bewegten Bezugsysteme laufen alle 
inneren optischen Vorgänge so ab, als wenn es im Äther ruhte. 

Zur Erklärung dieser Tatsache lagen zwei Theorien vor; die eine von 
Stokes nahm an, daß der Äther innerhalb der Materie von dieser voll- 
ständig mitgeführt werde, die zweite von Fresnel dagegen begnügte sich 
mit einer teilweisen Mitführung, deren Betrag sie aus den Experimenten 
ableiten konnte. Wir haben gesehen, daß die Stokessche Theorie bei 
konsequenter Durchführung in Schwierigkeiten gerät, die Fresnelsche aber 
alle Erscheinungen befriedigend darstellt. 

In der elektromagnetischen Theorie sind genau dieselben beiden Stand- 
punkte möglich: entweder vollständige Mitführung nach Stokes, oder teil- 



Hertz' Theorie der bewegten Körper. 



147 



weise nach Fresnel. Es fragt sich, ob sich aus rein elektromagnetischen 
Beobachtungen eine Entscheidung zwischen beiden Hypothesen gewinnen 
läßt. 

Die Hypothese der vollständigen Mitführung hat zuerst Hertz systema- 
tisch auf die Maxwellschen Feldgleichungen übertragen. Er war sich 
dabei völlig bewußt, daß ein solches Vorgehen nur provisorisch sein konnte, 
weil bei der Anwendung auf die optischen Vorgänge dieselben Schwierig- 
keiten auftreten mußten, an denen die Stokessche Theorie scheitert; aber 
die Einfachheit einer Theorie, bei der zwischen Bewegung des Äthers 
und der Materie nicht unterschieden zu werden brauchte, veranlaßte ihn, 
sie ausführlich zu entwickeln und zu diskutieren. Dabei zeigte es sich, 
daß die Induktionserscheinungen in bewegten Leitern^ die für die 
experimentelle Physik und die Technik bei weitem die größte Bedeutung 
haben, von der Hertzschen Theorie richtig wiedergegeben werden; Wider- 
sprüche mit der Erfahrung treten erst bei feineren Experimenten auf, bei 
denen die Verschiebungen in Nichtleitern eine Rolle spielen. Wir wollen 
alle Möglichkeiten der Reihe nach untersuchen: 

i) Bewegter Leiter a) im elektrischen Felde, 

b) im magnetischen Felde. 

2) Bewegter Isolator a) im elektrischen Felde, 

b) im magnetischen Felde. 

la) Ein Leiter bekommt im elektrischen Felde Oberflächenladungen. 
Wird er bewegt, so nimmt er diese mit; bewegte Ladungen müssen aber 
einem Strome äquivalent sein und daher nach dem Biot-Savartschen 
Gesetze ein umschlingendes Magnetfeld 
erzeugen. Um eine anschauliche Vor- 
stellung zu haben, denken wir uns einen 
Plattenkondensator, dessen Platten der 
^2-Ebene parallel sind (Abb. 98). Sie 
seien entgegengesetzt geladen, und zwar 
sei auf der Flächeneinheit einer Platte 
die Elektrizitätsmenge e. Nun werde 
die eine Platte gegen die andere in der 
;c-Richtung mit der Geschwindigkeit v 
bewegt; dann ensteht ein Mitführungs- 
oder Konvektions Strom. Die bewegte 
Platte verschiebt sich in der Zeiteinheit 
um die Länge v\ ist ihr Querschnitt 

senkrecht zur ;c- Achse gleich ^, so tritt durch eine zur j^-Ebene 
parallele Ebene in der Zeiteinheit die Elektrizitätsmenge eqv^ also ein 
Strom von der Dichte ev. Dieser muß genau dieselbe magnetische 
Wirkung ausüberl wie ein durch die ruhende Platte fließender Leitungs- 
strom der Dichte i = ev. 

Das ist im Laboratorium von Helmholtz durch H. A. Rowland (1875) 
und später genauer von A. Eichenwald (1903) experimentell bestätigt

worden. Statt der geradlinig bewegten Platte wurde dabei eine rotierende 
Metallscheibe benützt. 

ib) Wenn Leiter im magnetischen Felde bewegt werden, so entstehen 
in ihnen elektrische Felder und dadurch Ströme. Das ist die schon von 
Faraday entdeckte und quantitativ erforschte Erscheinung der Induktion 
durch Bewegung. Der einfachste Fall ist dieser: Das Magnetfeld ZT, etwa 
durch einen Hufeisenmagneten erzeugt, sei parallel der 2;-Achse (Abb. 99); 
parallel zur j/-Achse sei ein gerades Drahtstück der Länge i, und dieses 
werde in der ^-Richtung mit der Geschwindigkeit v bewegt. Dann ergibt 
die Hertzsche Theorie, daß in diesem Drahte ein elektrisches Feld parallel 
der negativen jj;- Richtung induziert wird; schließt man den Draht durch 
einen an der Bewegung unbeteiligten Bügel, wie in der Figur angedeutet, 
zur geschlossenen Leitung, so fließt in dieser ein Induktionsstrom. Man 
beweist das am einfachsten, indem man das Faradaysche Induktions- 
gesetz so ausspricht: der in einem geschlossenen Drahte induzierte Strom

Abb. 99. 




>t/ 



Abb. 100. 



ist proportional der sekundlichen Änderung der Kraftlinienzahl oder der 
magnetischen Verschiebung (t^ZT, die von dem Drahte umschlossen wird. 
Durch die Bewegung des Drahtes nimmt diese Zahl offenbar um ^xHv 

V 

pro sec zu; daher ist die mduzierte elektrische Feldstärke gleich i^iH 

Dieses Gesetz ist die Grundlage aller Maschinen und Apparate der 
Physik und Elektrotechnik, bei denen durch Induktion Bewegungsenergie 
in elektromagnetische Energie verwandelt wird; dazu gehören z. B. das 
Telephon, die Dynamomaschinen aller Arten. Das Gesetz kann daher als 
durch unzählige Erfahrungen völlig sichergestellt gelten. 

2 a) Die Bewegung eines Nichtleiters in einem elektrischen Felde denken 
wir uns so realisiert: Zwischen die beiden Platten des Kondensators der 
Abb. 98 werde eine bewegliche Scheibe aus dem Material des Nichtleiters 
gebracht (Abb. 100). Wird nun der Kondensator aufgeladen, so entsteht 
in der Scheibe ein elektrisches Feld E und eine Verschiebung ^E senk- 
recht zur Plattenebene, also parallel der j)/-Richtung; dadurch laden sich 



Hertz' Theorie der bewegten Körper. I^g 

die beiden Grenzflächen der isolierenden Scheibe entgegengesetzt gleich 
wie die gegenüberstehende Metallplatte auf. Über die Größe dieser 
Ladung wissen wir folgendes: Auf S. 135 hatten wir gesehen, daß das 
Coulombsche Gesetz nach Maxwells Auffassung die Größe der Verschiebung 
um eine geladene Kugel mit deren Ladung e in Zusammenhang bringt; 
es ist nämlich für eine Kugel vom Radius r 

E ^= — ^ oder eE = ~^- 
er r' 

Nun hat aber diese Kugel die Oberfläche 4/^^', also ist die Ladung 
pro Einheit der Fläche 

e eE 

/^Ttr^ 47t 

Übertragen wir das auf den Fall des Kondensators, so wird die Ober- 
flächendichte auf den Grenzebenen der isolierenden Platte ebensogroß 
sein wie auf den Metallplatten und mit dem elektrischen Felde E in der 
Beziehung 

__sE 

stehen. 

Wenn jetzt die isolierende Schicht mit der Geschwindigkeit v in der 
^-Richtung bewegt wird, so soll nach Hertz der Äther in der Schicht 
vollkommen mitgenommen werden; also werden auch das Feld E und 

eE 

die von diesem auf den Grenzebenen erzeugten Ladungen e = — mit- 

geführt. 

Die bewegte Ladung einer Grenzfläche stellt also wieder einen Strom 

eE 
von der Dichte — v dar und muß nach dem Biot-Savartschen Gesetze 
47r 

ein Magnetfeld erzeugen. 

Daß das der Fall ist, hat W. C. Röntgen (1885) experimentell nach- 
gewiesen; aber die Ablenkung der Magnetnadel, die er beobachtete, war 
viel kleiner, als sie nach der Hertzschen Theorie sein sollte. Es verhält 
sich nach seinen Messungen so, als wenn nicht der ganze Äther von der 
Scheibe mitgenommen würde, sondern nur ein Teil. Ein anderer Teil 
aber bleibt in Ruhe. Bestände die Scheibe aus reinem Äther, so wäre 

£ == I und die influenzierte Ladung gleich — ; Röntgens Versuche zeigen, 

f. rp Tf 

daß nur der Überschuß der Laduno^ über diesen Betras:, also 

° "=" 47r 47r 

= — (e — i), an der Bewegung der Materie teilnimmt. Dieses Resultat 

4 7t 

werden wir nachher in einfacher Weise deuten. Hier stellen wir nur fest, 
daß, wie nach den bekannten Tatsachen der Optik zu erwarten war, die 



I50 



Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 



Hertzsche Theorie der vollständigen Mitführung auch bei rein elektro- 
magnetischen Vorgängen versagt. 

Eichenwald hat (1903) das Röntgensche Resultat dadurch sehr ein- 
drucksvoll bestätigt, daß er die geladenen Metallplatten an der Bewegung 
teilnehmen ließ. Diese liefern einen Konvektionsstrom von der Stärke ev^ 
die isolierende Schicht müßte wegen der entgegengesetzt gleichen Ladungen 
nach Hertz diesen genau kompensieren. Eichenwald aber fand, daß das 
nicht der Fall ist; vielmehr erhielt er einen von dem Material des Iso- 
lators gänzlich unabhängigen Strom. Genau das ist nach Röntgens Resultat 
der teilweisen Mitführung zu erwarten; denn der vom Isolator herrührende 



Strom ist 



das erste Glied desselben wird von dem Kon- 



4^/ E 

vektionsstrom ev kompensiert, und es bleibt der Strom — v übrig, der 

4 ^ 

von der Dielektrizitätskonstante £ unabhängig ist. 

2 b) Wir denken uns ein zur 2-Achse paralleles Magnetfeld, etwa durch 

einen Hufeisenmagneten rea- 
''7 lisiert, und eine Scheibe aus 

nichtleitendem Material durch 
das Feld in der ^-Richtung 
bewegt (Abb. i o i ). Da es keine 
Nichtleiter gibt, die merklich 
magnetisierbar sind, wollen 
wir ^t = I annehmen. Die 
beiden, zur J^'- Achse senk- 
rechten Grenzflächen der 
Scheibe seien mit Metall be- 
legt; die Belegungen mögen 
durch Gleitkontakte mit einem 
daß man die auf ihnen ent-

Elektrometer in Verbindung stehen, so 
stehende Ladung messen kann. 

Dieser Versuch entspricht genau dem unter i b) erörterten Induktions- 
versuche, nur tritt an die Stelle des bewegten Leiters ein bewegtes Di- 
elektrikum. Das Induktionsgesetz läßt sich in derselben Weise anwenden, 
es fordert die Existenz eines in der negativen j^-Richtung wirkenden elek- 
trischen Feldes E = vH^ wenn die Dicke der Scheibe gleich i ist. 
Daher müssen nach der Hertzschen Theorie die beiden Belegungen ent- 

F F £ 1) H 

gegengesetzte Ladungen von der Flächendichte - — = zeigen, die 

einen Ausschlag des Elektrometers veranlassen. Der Versuch ist (1905) 
von H.A. Wilson (mit rotierendem Dielektrikum) angestellt worden und 
bestätigte zwar die Existenz der Aufladung, aber wiederum in geringerem

Betrage, nämlich entsprechend einer Flächendichte (e — i) — — • Es ver- 
hält sich wieder so, als nähme nicht der ganze Äther an der Bewegung

der Materie teil, sondern nur so viel, wie diese stärker dielektrisch ist als 
das Vakuum. Auch hier versagt die Hertzsche Theorie. 

Bei allen diesen vier typischen Erscheinungen kommt es offenbar nur 
auf die relative Bewegung der felderzeugenden Körper gegen den unter- 
suchten Leiter oder Isolator an. Anstatt diesen in der ^-Richtung zu 
bewegen, wie wir es getan haben, könnte man ihn festhalten und die 
übrigen Teile des Apparates in der negativen :r-Richtung bewegen; das 
Ergebnis müßte das gleiche sein. Die Hertzsche Theorie kennt eben nur 
relative Bewegungen der Körper, wobei der Äther ebenfalls als Körper 
gilt. In einem translatorisch bewegten Systeme laufen alle Vorgänge nach 
Hertz genau so ab, als wenn es ruhte; es gilt also das klassische Rela- 
tivitätsprinzip. 

Aber die Hertzsche Theorie ist mit den Tatsachen unvereinbar und 
mußte bald einer anderen Platz machen, die hinsichtlich der Relativität 
genau den entgegengesetzten Standpunkt einnahm. 

12. Die Elektronentheorie von Lorentz. 

Das ist die Theorie von H. A. Lorentz (1892), die den Höhepunkt 
und Abschluß der Physik des substantiellen Äthers bedeutete. 

Sie ist eine atomistisch weiterentwickelte Ein-Fluidum-Theorie der 
Elektrizität; hierdurch ist auch, wie wir sogleich sehen werden, die Rolle 
bestimmt, die sie dem Äther zuweist. 

Daß die elektrischen Ladungen atomistische Struktur haben, in kleinsten, 
unteilbaren Mengen auftreten, hat Helmholtz (188 1) zuerst ausgesprochen, 
um die Faradayschen Gesetze der Elektrolyse (S. 121) verständlich zu 
machen. In der Tat braucht man nur anzunehmen, daß jedes Atom in 
elektrolytischer Lösung eine Art chemischer Verbindung mit einem Elek- 
trizitätsatom oder Elektron eingeht, um zu verstehen, daß eine bestimmte 
Elektrizitätsmenge immer äquivalente Substanzmengen zur Abscheidung 
bringt. 

Die Atomistik der Elektrizität bewährte sich besonders zur Erklärung 
der Erscheinungen, die man beim Durchgang des elektrischen Stroms 
durch ein verdünntes Gas beobachtet. 

Hier entdeckte man zuerst, daß die y--^ ^ — — ->.

sich durchaus verschieden verhalten. ^-— — _T^ _J

sehen ihnen übergehen läßt (Abb. 102), 

so erhält man sehr komplizierte Erscheinungen, solange noch Gas von 
merklichem Drucke in dem Rohre ist; entfernt man das Gas aber mehr 
und mehr, so wird das Bild immer einfacher. Bei sehr hohem Vakuum geht 
von der negativen Elektrode, der Kathode K^ ein Strahl bläulichen Lichtes 
geradlinig aus, ohne sich darum zu kümmern, wo der positive Pol, die 



152 ^^^ Grandgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

Anode ^, sich befindet. Diese Kathodenstrahlen ^ die Plücker (1858) 
entdeckte, wurden von manchen für Lichtwellen gehalten, denn sie warfen, 
wie Hittorf (1869) zeigte, Schatten von festen Körpern, die man 
in ihren Weg stellte; andere hielten sie für eine materielle Emanation, 
die von der Kathode ausgeschleudert wird. Crookes, der diesen Stand- 
punkt vertrat (1879), nannte die Strahlen den >vierten Aggregatzustand« 
der Materie. Für die materielle Natur der Strahlen sprach vor allem der 
Umstand, daß sie durch einen Magneten abgelenkt werden, und zwar 
gerade so, wie ein Strom negativer Elektrizität. Den größten Anteil an 
der Erforschung der Natur der Kathodenstrahlen haben J. J. Thomson 
und Ph. Lenard. Es gelang, die negative Ladung der Strahlen durch 
direktes Auffangen nachzuweisen; auch werden sie von einem quer zu 
ihrer Bahn angebrachten elektrischen Felde abgelenkt, und zwar entgegen 
der Feldrichtung, was wieder die negative Ladung beweist. 

Die Überzeugung von der korpuskularen Natur der Kathodenstrahlen 
brach sich Bahn, als es gelang, quantitative Schlüsse auf ihre Geschwin- 
digkeit und Ladung zu ziehen. 

Stellen wir uns den Kathodenstrahl als einen Strom kleiner Teilchen 
von der Masse w vor, so wird er offenbar von einem bestimmten elektrischen 
oder magnetischen Felde um so weniger abgelenkt, je größer seine Ge- 
schwindigkeit ist; geradeso, wie eine Gewehrkugel um so »rasanter« fliegt, 
je schneller sie ist. Man kann nun sehr stark ablenkbare, also ganz 
langsame Kathodenstrahlen herstellen; diese kann man künstlich so stark 
beschleunigen, daß ihre Anfangsgeschwindigkeit neben der Endgeschwin- 
digkeit vernachlässigt werden kann. 
Dazu bringt man vor der Kathode K 
ein Drahtnetz A^an (Abb. 103) und 
ladet dieses stark positiv; dann wer- 
den die negativen Katho:lenstrahl- 
Abb. 103. teilchen in dem Felde zwischen Ka- 

thode und Drahtnetz sehr stark 
beschleunigt und treten durch die Maschen des Net^xs mit einer Geschwin- 
digkeit, die wesentlich nur von dieser Beschleunigung herrührt. Diese 
kann man aber berechnen nach der Grundgleichung der Mechanik 

mb =^ K = e Ej 

wenn e die Ladung, E die Feldstärke ist; man hat offenbar eine »Fall- 
bewegung« , bei der die Beschleunigung nicht gleich der Schwerebe- 

e e 

schleunigung g. sondern gleich — E ist. Wäre das Verhältnis ^ bekannt, 

m m ^ 

so könnte man die Geschwindigkeit v aus den Fallgesetzen finden. Man 

e 
hat aber zwei Unbekannte, — und v. und braucht daher noch eine Messun«: 

m 

zu ihrer Bestimmung. Diese gewinnt man durch Anbringung eines seit- 
lichen magnetischen Feldes. Wir haben bei der Besprechung der Hertzschen 





Die Elektronentheorie von Lorentz. I c a 

Theorie (V, ii, i b, S. 148) gesehen, daß ein Magnetfeld ^ in einem senk- 

V 

recht zu H bewegten Körper eine elektrische Feldstärke E = H hervor- 
ruft, die sowohl auf ZT als auf Z' senkrecht steht. Daher wird auch auf jedes 

V 

Kathodenstrahlteilchen eine ablenkende Kraft e E = e — H angreifen, so 

c 

daß senkrecht zur ursprünglichen Bewegung eine Beschleunigung b ■=^ H 

m c 

entsteht. Diese läßt sich durch Messung der seitlichen Ablenkung des 

Strahles finden; also hat man eine zweite Gleichung zur Bestimmung der 

beiden Unbekannten — und v. 

m 

Die nach dieser oder einer ähnlichen Methode ausgeführten Be- 
stimmungen haben nun ergeben, daß für nicht zu große Geschwindig- 

€ 

keiten — tatsächlich einen bestimmten, konstanten Wert hat, und zwar: 
m 

(65) i^^'^''^°'' 

elektrostatische Ladungseinheiten pro Gramm. Andererseits haben wir 
bei der Besprechung der Elektrolyse [V, 3, Formel (48), S. 123] angegeben, 
daß I g Wasserstoff die Elektrizitätsmenge Q = 2,90 •10^'^ transportiert. 
M.icht man nun die naheliegende Annahme, daß die Ladung einer Par- 
tikel beidemal dieselbe, nämlich ein Elektrizitätsatom oder Elektron ist, 
so muß man schließen, . daß die Masse des Kathodenstrahlteilchens m 
sich zu der des Wasserstoffatoms mh verhält wie: 

,... m e e 2,90 • lo^'^ i 

(66) . _ . _ _ 



fiiH niH m 5,31 • IG ^ 1830 

Die Kathodenstrahlteilchen sind also etwa 2 000 mal leichter als die 
Wasserstoffatome, die ihrerseits die leichtesten aller Atome sind. Dieses 
Ergebnis legt den Schluß nahe, daß man in den Kathodenstrahlen einen 
Strom von reinen Elektrizitätsatomen vor sich hat. 

Diese Auffassung hat sich nun bei unzähligen Untersuchungen durch- 
aus bewährt. Die negative Elektrizität besteht aus den frei beweglichen 
Elektronen, die positive aber ist an die Materie gebunden und tritt nie- 
mals ohne diese auf. Die neuere Experimentalforschung hat damit die 
Hypothese der alten Ein-Fluidumtheorie bestätigt und präzisiert. Es ist 
auch gelungen, die Größe der Ladung e des einzelnen Elektrons zu be- 
stimmen. Die ersten Versuche dieser Art sind von J. J. Thomson (1898) 
unternommen worden. Der Grundgedanke ist der: Kleine Tröpfchen aus 
Ol, Wasser oder Kügelchen aus Metall von mikroskopischen oder sub- 
mikroskopischen Dimensionen, die durch Kondensation von Dampf oder 
Zerstäuben in Luft hergestellt werden, fallen mit konstanter Geschwindig- 



154 ^^^ Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

keit, indem die Luftreibung die Entstehung von Beschleunigungen ver- 
hindert. Durch Messung der Fallgeschwindigkeit kann man die Größe 
der Teilchen bestimmen und durch Multiplikation mit der Dichte ihre 
Masse M. Das Gewicht eines solchen Teilchens ist dann Mg, wo 
^ := 981 cm/sec"^ die Erdbeschleunigung ist. Nun kann man solche 
Teilchen elektrisch laden, indem man die Luft der Einwirkung von 
Röntgenstrahlen oder Strahlen radioaktiver Substanzen aussetzt. Bringt 
man dann ein vertikal aufwärts gerichtetes elektrisches Feld ^ an, so 
wird ein Kügelchen von der Ladung e von diesem nach oben gezogen, 
und wenn die elektrische Kraft e E gleich dem Gewichte Mg ist, wird 
es schweben. Aus der Gleichung e E = Mg kann man nun die La- 
dung e berechnen. Millikan (1910), der die schärfsten Versuche dieser 
Art gemacht hat, hat gefunden, daß die Ladung kleiner Tröpfchen immer 
ein ganzzahliges Multiplum einer bestimmten kleinsten Ladung ist; diese 
wird man also als das elektrische Elementar quantum ansprechen. Seine 
Größe ist: 
(67) <? = 4,77.10- 



— 10 



elektrostatische Einheiten. Allerdings werden Millikans Versuche von 
Ehrenhaft bestritten; doch ist es wahrscheinlich, daß die Unter- 
schreitungen der Elementarladung, die dieser gefunden hat, darauf be- 
ruhen, daß er mit zu kleinen Kugeln operiert, bei denen sekundäre Er- 
scheinungen auftreten. 

Für die Lorentzsche Elektronentheorie spielt die absolute Größe der 
Elementarladung keine wesentliche Rolle. Wir wollen jetzt das Bild der 
physikalischen Welt schildern, wie es Lorentz entworfen hat. 

Die materiellen Atome sind die Träger der positiven Elektrizität, die 
mit ihnen untrennbar verbunden ist; außerdem enthalten sie aber eine 
Anzahl negativer Elektronen, so daß sie nach außen elektrisch neutral 
erscheinen. In den Nichtleitern sind die Elektronen fest an die Atome 
gebunden; sie können nur aus ihren Gleichgewichtslagen etwas verschoben 
werden, wodurch das Atom zum Dipol wird. In Elektrolyten und in 
leitenden Gasen kommt es vor, daß ein Atom ein Elektron oder mehrere 
zu viel oder zu wenig hat; dann heißt es ein Ion oder Träger und 
wandert im elektrischen Felde unter gleichzeitigem Transport von Elek- 
trizität und Materie. In Metallen bewegen sich die Elektronen frei um- 
her, wobei sie nur durch Zusammenstöße mit den Atomen der Substanz 
einen Widerstand erfahren. Der Magnetismus kommt dadurch zustande, 
daß in gewissen Atomen die Elektronen in geschlossenen Bahnen kreisen 
und dadurch Amp^resche Molekularströme darstellen. 

Die Elektronen und die positiven Atomladungen schwimmen im Äther- 
meer, in dem ein elektromagnetisches Feld nach den Maxwellschen Glei- 
chungen besteht; nur ist in diesen £ = i, (.1 = 1 zu setzen und an die 
Stelle der Leitungsstromdichte tritt der Konvektionsstrom der Elektronen 
Qv. Sie lauten also 



Die Elektronentheorie von Lorentz. 155

und fassen die Gesetze von Coulomb, Biot-Savart und Faraday in der 
bekannten Weise zusammen. 

Alle elektromagnetischen Vorgänge bestehen also im Grunde aus den 
Bewegungen von Elektronen und den sie begleitenden Feldern. Die ganze 
Materie ist dn elektrisches Phänomen. Die verschiedenen Eigenschaften 
der Materie beruhen auf den Verschiedenheiten der Beweglichkeit der 
Elektronen gegen die Atome, wie wir es soeben geschildert haben. Die 
Elektronentheorie hat nun die Aufgabe, aus den Grundgesetzen (68) für 
die einzeln unsichtbaren Elektronen und Atome die gewöhnlichen Max- 
wellschen Gleichungen abzuleiten, d. h. zu zeigen, daß die materiellen 
Körper je nach ihrer Natur eine Leitfähigkeit ö", eine Dielektrizitätskon- 
stante € und eine Permeabilität /tt zu haben scheinen. 

Lorentz hat diese Aufgabe gelöst und gezeigt, daß die Elektronen- 
theorie nicht nur im einfachsten Falle die Maxwellschen Gesetze liefert, 
sondern darüber hinaus die Erklärung zahlreicher Feinheiten ermöglicht, 
die der beschreibenden Theorie gar nicht oder nur mit Hilfe künsthcher 
Hypothesen zugänglich waren. Dazu gehören vor allem die feineren 
Phänomene der Optik, die Farbenzerstreuung, die von Faraday entdeckte 
magnetische Drehung der Polarisationsebene (S. 140) und ähnliche Wechsel- 
wirkungen zwischen Lichtwellen und elektrischen oder magnetischen Fel- 
dern. Wir können auf diese umfangreiche und mathematisch verwickelte 
Theorie nicht eingehen und wollen uns auf die Frage beschränken, die 
uns vor allem interessiert: Welchen Anteil nimmt der Äther an den Be- 
wegungen der Materie? 

Lorentz stellt die höchst radikale und vorher noch nie mit dieser Be- 
stimmtheit geäußerte Behauptung auf: 

Der Äther ruht absolut im Räume. 

Damit sind im Prinzip absoluter Raum und Äther völlig identifiziert. 
Der absolute Raum ist kein Vakuum, sondern ein Etwas von bestimmten 
Eigenschaften, dessen Zustand durch Angabe zweier gerichteter Größen, 
des elektrischen Feldes E und des magnetischen Feldes Zf, beschrieben 
wird, und das als solches Äther heißt. 

Diese Annahme geht noch etwas weiter als die Theorie Fresnels. 
Dort ruhte der Äther des Weltenraumes in einem Inertialsystem , wofür 
man auch absolute Ruhe sagen könnte ; aber der Äther innerhalb der 
materiellen Körper wird von diesen zum Teil mitgeführt. 

Lorentz kann auch auf diese partielle Mitführung Fresnels verzichten 
und kommt doch praktisch zu genau demselben Ergebnisse. Um das ein- 
zusehen, betrachten wir den Vorgang innerhalb eines Dielektrikums zwischen 
den Platten eines Kondensators. Wenn dieser geladen wird, so entsteht

ein zu den Platten senkrechtes Feld (Abb. 104) und dieses verschiebt die 
Elektronen in den Atomen der dielektrischen Substanz und verwandelt 
sie in Dipole, so, wie wir es früher (S. 131, 135) erläutert haben. Die 

dielektrische Verschiebung im Sinne Maxwells ist 

sE, aber nur ein Teil derselben rührt von der 

wirklichen Verschiebung der Elektronen her ; denn 

das Vakuum hat die Dielektrizitätskonstante e = i, 

also die Verschiebung E^ folglich ist der Anteil der 

Elektronenverschiebung nur eE — E = [e — i) ^. 

Wir haben nun gesehen, daß die Experimente von 

Röntgen und Wilson über die Erscheinungen in 

bewegten Isolatoren aussagen, daß tatsächlich nur 

dieser Anteil der Verschiebung an der Bewegung 

teilnimmt. Die Lorentzsche Theorie stellt also 

die elektromagnetischen Tatsachen richtig dar, ohne es nötig zu haben, 

den Äther irgendwie an der Bewegung der Materie teilnehmen zu lassen. 

Daß auch die Mitführung des Lichtes in genauer Übereinstimmung mit 

der Fresnelschen Formel (43), S. 106, herauskommt, machen wir uns so 

plausibel: Wir betrachten wie bei 
dem Wilsonschen Versuche einen 
dielektrischen Körper, der sich in 
der ;t:-Richtung mit der Geschwin- 
digkeit V bewegt und in dem ein 
Lichtstrahl in derselben Richtung 
läuft (Abb. 105). Dieser bestehe 
aus einer elektrischen Schwingung 
E parallel zur jf- Achse und einer 
magnetischen H parallel zur 
0-Achse. Nun wissen wir aber 
aus dem Wdsonschen Versuche, daß ein solches Magnetfeld im bewegten 
Körper eine zusätzliche elektrische Verschiebung in der jK-Richtung vom 
Betrage (e — i)vH erzeugt; daraus erhält man ein zusätzliches elek- 
trisches Feld durch Division mit e. Das gesamte elektrische Feld ist also

Würde die Mitführung vollständig sein, wie die Hertzsche Theorie 
voraussetzt, so würde statt € — i nur £ stehen, also das gesamte Feld 
die Größe E -\- v H \\2htxi. Man sieht, daß wegen der partiellen Mit- 
führung V durch

zu ersetzen ist. Diese Größe müßte also der absoluten Geschwindigkeit 
des Äthers innerhalb der Materie nach der Fresnelschen Theorie ent- 
sprechen, d. h. der in der Optik mit (/) bezeichneten Mitführungszahl,

Formel (43). Und das ist tatsächlich auch genau der Fall; denn nach 
der Maxwellschen Lichttheorie (S. 142) ist ja die Dielektrizitätskonstante £ 
gleich dem Quadrate des Brechungsindex «, £ = «". Setzt man das ein, 
so erhält man

in Übereinstimmung mit der Formel (43), S. 106. 

Wir erinnern uns, daß der Fresnelschen Theorie Schwierigkeilen durch 
die Farbenzerstreuung erwuchsen. Denn wenn der Brechungsindex n von 
der Frequenz (Farbe) des Lichtes abhängt, so auch die Mitftihrungszahl cp ; 
der Äther kann doch aber nur in einer bestimmten Weise mitgenommen 
werden, nicht für jede Farbe anders. Diese Schwierigkeit fällt in der 
Elektronen theorie ganz fort; denn der Äther bleibt in Ruhe, was mit- 
genommen wird, sind die in der Materie sitzenden Elektronen, und die 
Farbenzerstreuung beruht darauf, daß diese vom Lichte zum Mitschwingen 
gebracht werden und rückwirkend die Lichtgeschwindigkeit beeinflussen. 

Wir können auf die Einzelheiten dieser weitverzweigten Lehre nicht 
eingehen, sondern fassen das Resultat so zusammen: 

Die Lorentzsche Theorie setzt die Existenz eines absolut ruhenden 
Äthers voraus; sodann beweist sie, daß trotzdem alle elektromagnetischen 
und optischen Erscheinungen nur von den relativen Translationsbewegungen 
der materiellen Körper abhängen, soweit Glieder i. Ordnung in ß in 
Betracht kommen. Sie erklärt daher alle bekannten Vorgänge, vor allem 
die Tatsache, daß die absolute Bewegung der Erde durch den Äther 
durch irdische Experimente bezüglich Größen i. Ordnung nicht nach- 
weisbar ist (das optische oder besser elektromagnetische Relativitätsprinzip). 

Ein Experiment (i. Ordnung) aber ist denkbar, das sich durch die 
Lorentzsche Theorie ebensowenig erklären ließe, wie durch alle vorher 
besprochenen Äthertheorien: das wäre ein Versagen der Römerschen Me- 
thode zur Feststellung einer absoluten Bewegung des ganzen Sonnensystems 
(s. S. 100, in). 

Entscheidend für die Lorentzsche Theorie wird sein, ob sie auch noch 
bei Versuchen standhält, die Größen 2. Ordnung in ß zu messen erlauben. 
Denn durch solche müßte sich die absolute Bewegung der Erde durch 
den Äther feststellen lassen. Ehe wir aber auf diese Frage eingehen, 
haben wir noch von einer Leistung der Lorentzschen Elektronen theorie 
zu sprechen, durch die sie ihren Umfang gewaltig erweitert hat: die 
elektrodynamische Deutung der Trägheit. 

13. Die elektromagnetische Masse. 

Dem Leser wird aufgefallen sein, daß von dem Augenblicke an, da 
wir den elastischen Äther verlassen und uns dem elektrodynamischen zu- 
gewandt haben, von der Mechanik wenig mehr die Rede war. Die 
mechanischen und die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge bilden je ein Reich 



1^3 ^^^ Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

für sich; die ersteren spielen sich im Newtonschen absoluten Räume ab, 
der durch die Gültigkeit des Trägheitsgesetzes definiert ist und seine 
Existenz in Fliehkräften zu erkennen gibt, die letzteren sind Zustände des 
im absoluten Räume ruhenden Äthers. Eine umfassende Theorie, wie die 
Lorentzsche sein will, kann diese beiden Reiche nicht nebeneinander un- 
verknüpft bestehen lassen. 

Nun haben wir gesehen, daß eine Zurückführung der Elektrodynamik 
auf Mechanik trotz unerhörter darauf verwandter Mühe der scharfsinnigsten 
Forscher nicht befriedigend gelungen ist. 

Da taucht der umgekehrte, kühne Gedanke auf: Läßt sich nicht die 
Mechanik auf die Elektrodynamik zurückführen ? 

Wenn dies gelänge, so wäre damit der abstrakte absolute Raum 
Newtons in den konkreten Äther verwandelt; die Trägheitswiderstände 
und Fliehkräfte müßten als physikalische Wirkungen des Äthers, etwa als 
besonders gestaltete elektromagnetische Felder erscheinen, das Relativitäts- 
prinzip der Mechanik aber müßte seine strenge Geltung verlieren und 
nur, wie das der Elektrodynamik, näherungsweise für Größen i. Ordnung 

m p = — richtig sein. 

Die Wissenschaft hat diesen Schritt, der die Rangordnung der Begriffe 
so ganz auf den Kopf stellt, nicht gescheut. Und obwohl die Lehre vom 
absolut ruhenden Äther später hat fallen müssen, so ist doch diese Revolu- 
tion, die die Mechanik von ihrem Thron stürzte und die Elektrodynamik 
zur Herrscherin der Physik erhob, nicht vergeblich gewesen; ihr Resultat 
hat in einer etwas abgeänderten Form Geltung behalten. 

Wir haben oben (S. 141) gesehen, daß die Fortpflanzung elektro- 
magnetischer Wellen dadurch zustande kommt, daß die Wechselwirkung 
zwischen elektrischer und magnetischer Feldstärke einen der mechanischen 
Trägheit analogen Effekt hervorbringt. Ein elektromagnetisches Feld 
hat ein Beharrungsvermögen, ganz ähnlich wie eine mechanische Masse; 
um es herzustellen, muß Arbeit aufgewandt werden, und wenn es ver- 
nichtet wird, kommt diese Arbeit wieder zum Vorschein. Man sieht dies 

bei allen Vorgängen, die mit elektromagnetischen 
Schwingungen verbunden sind,, z. B. bei den 
Apparaten für drahtlose Telegraphie. Eine draht- 
lose Sendestation enthält einen elektrischen 
Oszillator, der im wesentlichen aus einer Funken- 
<p strecke J^, einer Spule S und einem Konden- 
sator Ä', d. h. zwei voneinander isolierten Metall- 
platten, besteht, die, durch Drähte verbunden, 
Abb. 106. einen »offenen« Stromkreis bilden (Abb. 106).! 

Der Kondensator wird aufgeladen, bis ein Funkej 
bei F überspringt ; dabei entlädt sich der Kondensator wieder, die aufge- 
speicherten Elektrizitätsmengen fließen ab. Sie gleichen sich aber nich^ 
einfach aus, sondern schießen über das Gleichgewicht herüber und sammeh

sich wieder auf den Kondensatorplatten, nur mit umgekehrtem Vorzeichen, 
geradeso, wie ein Pendel durch die Gleichgewichtslage durchschwingt und 
nach der andern Seite ausschlägt. Ist die neue Aufladung des Konden- 
sators beendet, strömt die Elektrizität wieder zurück und pendelt hin und 
her, bis ihre Energie durch Erwärmung der Leitungsdrähte oder Abgabe 
an andere Teile der Apparatur, z. B. die ausstrahlende Antenne, verbraucht 
ist. Das Schwingen der Elektrizität beweist also das Beharrungsvermögen 
des Feldes, das der Massenträgheit der Pendelkugel genau entspricht. Die 
Maxwellsche Theorie stellt diese Tatsache in allen Einzelheiten richtig dar; 
man kann die elektromagnetischen Schwingungen, die bei einer bestimmten 
Apparatur auftreten, aus den Feldgleichungen im voraus berechnen. 

J. J. Thomson hat hieraus den Schluß gezogen, daß die Trägheit eines 
Körpers durch eine ihm erteilte elektrische Ladung vergrößert werden muß. 
Betrachten wir eine geladene Kugel zuerst in Ruhe, dann in Bewegung 
mit der Geschwindigkeit v. Die ruhende Kugel hat ein elektrosta- 
tisches Feld mit radial auslaufenden Kraftlinien, die bewegte Kugel hat 
überdies ein magnetisches Feld mit kreisförmigen Kraftlinien, die die 
Bahn der Kugel umschlingen (Abb. 107); denn eine bewegte Ladung ist 
ein Konvektionsstrom und

nach demBiot-Savartschen 
Gesetze. Beide Zustände 
haben das geschilderte Be- 
harrungsvermögen ; der 
eine kann in den andern 
nur durch Arbeitsaufwand 
übergeführt werden. Die 
Kraft, die nötig ist, die 
Kugel aus der Ruhe in 

Bewegung zu setzen, ist also für die geladene Kugel größer, als für die 
ungeladene. Um die schon bewegte geladene Kugel noch weiter zu be- 
schleunigen, muß offenbar das Magnetfeld H verstärkt werden; also ist 
wieder eine vergrößerte Kraft dazu notwendig. 

Wir erinnern uns, daß eine die kurze Zeit / wirkende Kraft K einen 
Impuls J = Kt darstellt, der eine Geschwindigkeitsänderung w einer 
Masse m nach der Formel (7) (II, 9, S. 27) 

mw = J 

erzeugt. Trägt die Masse eine Ladung, so wird ein bestimmter Impuls 
/ nur eine kleinere Geschwindigkeitsänderung hervorrufen, der Rest J' 
wird zur Veränderung des Magnetfeldes verbraucht; es ist also 

mw = y^ — y. 

Nun ergibt die Rechnung das sehr plausible Resultat, daß der zur Ver- 
größerung des Magnetfeldes nötige Impuls /' um so größer ist, je größer 
die Geschwindigkeitsänderung w ist; und zwar ist er ihr näherungs weise 



l6o Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 



proportional. Man kann also J' = rn w setzen, wo m ein Proportio- 
nalitätsfaktor ist, der übrigens von dem Zustande, d. h. von der Ge- 
schwindigkeit V vor der Geschwindigkeitsänderung, abhängen kann. Dann 
wird 

mw = J — m'w 
oder 

[m -{- m)w = /. 

Es ist also so, als wenn die Masse m vermehrt wäre, und zwar um eine 
aus den elektromagnetischen Feldgleichungen zu berechnende Größe m\ 
die noch von der Geschwindigkeit v abhängig sein kann. Der genaue 
Wert von m für beliebige Geschwindigkeiten v läßt sich nur berechnen, 
wenn man Annahmen über die Verteilung der elektrischen Ladung über 
den bewegten Körper macht. Aber der Grenzwert für kleine Geschwindig- 
keiten relativ zur Lichtgeschwindigkeit ^, d. h. für kleine //, ergibt sich 
unabhängig von solchen Annahmen zu

wo U die elektrostatische Energie der Ladungen des Körpers ist. 

Wir haben gesehen, daß die Masse des Elektrons etwa 2000 mal kleiner 
ist als die des Wasserstoflfatoms. Daher liegt der Gedanke nahe, daß 
das Elektron vielleicht überhaupt keine »gewöhnliche« Masse besitzt, 
sondern nichts sei als »elektrische Ladung« an sich, und seine Masse 
durchaus elektromagnetischen Ursprungs. 

Ist eine solche Annahme mit den Kenntnissen vereinbar, die man 
über Größe, Ladung und Masse des Elektrons hat? 

Da die Elektronen Bausteine der Atome sein sollen, so müssen sie 
jedenfalls klein sein gegen die Größe der Atome. Nun weiß man aus 
der Atomphysik, daß der Radius der Atome von der Größenordnung 
io~^ cm ist; der Radius des Elektrons muß also wesentlich kleiner sein 
als io~^ cm. Stellt man sich das Elektron als eine Kugel vom Radius a 
mit der auf der Oberfläche verteilten Ladung e vor, so ist, wie sich aus 
dem Coulombschen Gesetze ableiten läßt, die elektrostatische Energie 

U=\ — ; daher wird die elektromagnetische Masse nach (69)

eine Länge, die etwa 100 000 mal kleiner ist als der Atomradius. 

Die Hypothese des rein elektromagnetischen Ursprungs der Elektronen- 
masse steht also nicht im Widerspruche zu den bekannten Tatsachen. 
Aber sie ist damit noch nicht bewiesen. 

Da fand die Theorie eine starke Stütze durch verfeinerte Beobachtungen 
an Kathodenstrahlen und /^-Strahlen radioaktiver Substanzen, die ebenfalls 
ausgeschleuderte Elektronen sind. Wir haben oben erläutert, daß man 
durch elektrische und magnetische Beeinflussung solcher Strahlen sowohl 

das Verhältnis von Ladung und Masse — , als auch ihre Geschwindigkeit v 

bestimmen kann und daß zunächst für — ein bestimmter Wert, unabhängig 

ni 

von z/, gefunden wurde. Als man aber zu größeren Geschwindigkeiten 

überorina:, fand sich eine Abnahme von — ; besonders bei /^-Strahlen des 

Radiums, die nur wenig langsamer sind als das Licht, war dieser Effekt 
sehr deutlich und konnte quantitativ gemessen werden. Daß die elek- 
trische Ladung von der Geschwindigkeit abhängen soll, war mit den Vor- 
stellungen der Elektronentheorie unvereinbar. Wohl aber mußte man eine 
Abhängigkeit der Masse von der Geschwindigkeit erwarten, wenn diese 
elektromagnetischen Ursprungs ist. Um eine quantitative Theorie zu ge- 
winnen, mußte man allerdings bestimmte Annahmen über die Form des 
Elektrons und die Verteilung der Ladung auf ihm machen. M. Abraham 
(1903) betrachtete das Elektron als starre Kugel mit einer gleichförmig 
über das Innere oder die Oberfläche verteilten Ladung und zeigte, daß 
beide Annahmen zu derselben Abhängigkeit der elektromagnetischen Masse 
von der Geschwindigkeit führen, nämlich zu einer Zunahme der Masse 
mit wachsender Geschwindigkeit. Je schneller das Elektron schon fliegt, 
um so mehr widersetzt sich das elektromagnetische Feld einer weiteren 
Geschwindigkeitszunahme. Die Zunahme von m erklärt die beobachtete 

Abnahme von — , und zwar stimmt die Abrahamsche Theorie auch quan- 
7n 

titativ recht gut mit den Messungsergebnissen von Kaufmann (1901), 
wenn man annimmt, daß keine »gewöhnliche« Masse neben der elektro- 
magnetischen vorhanden sei. 

Damit war das Ziel erreicht, die Trägheit der Elektronen auf elektro- 
magnetische Felder im Äther zurückzuführen. Zugleich eröffnete sich 
eine weite Perspektive. Da die Atome die Träger der positiven Elektrizität 
sind und außerdem zahlreiche Elektronen enthalten, so ist vielleicht ihre 
Masse ebenfalls elektromagnetischen Ursprungs? Dann wäre die Masse

als Quantität des Beharrungsvermögens kein Urphänomen, wie sie es in der 
elementaren Mechanik ist, sondern eine sekundäre Folge der Struktur des 
Äthers. Newtons absoluter Raum, der nur durch das mechanische Trägheits- 
gesetz definiert ist, wird damit überflüssig; seine Rolle übernimmt der durch 
seine elektromagnetischen Eigenschaften wohlbekannte Äther. Eine sehr 
konkrete, dem physikalischen Denken entsprechende Lösung des Raum- 
problems wäre gewonnen. 

Wir werden sehen (V, 15, S. 166), daß neue Tatsachen dieser Auf- 
fassung widersprechen; aber der Zusammenhang zwischen Masse und 
elektromagnetischer Energie, der hier zuerst entdeckt wurde, bedeutet 
eine fundamentale Erkenntnis, deren tiefer Sinn erst durch die Relativi- 
tätstheorie Einsteins zur rechten Geltung gebracht worden ist. 

Wir müssen noch nachtragen, daß außer der Abrahamschen Theorie 
des starren Elektrons auch andere Hypothesen aufgestellt und durch- 
gerechnet worden sind. Am wichtigsten ist die von H. A. Lorentz (1904), 
die mit der Relativitätstheorie in enger Beziehung steht. Er nahm an, 
daß das Elektron bei der Bewegung sich in der Bewegungsrichtung kon- 
trahiert, aus einer Kugel zu einem abgeplatteten Rotationsellipsoid wird; 
die Größe der Abplattung soll dabei in bestimmter Weise von der Ge- 
schwindigkeit abhängen. Diese Hypothese erscheint zunächst sehr sonderbar; 
sie liefert allerdings eine wesentlich einfachere Formel für die elektro- 
magnetische Masse in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der Geschwindigkeit, als die 
Abrahamsche Theorie, aber das wäre keine Rechtfertigung des Ansatzes. 
Diese liegt vielmelir in der Entwicklung begründet, die die Lorentzsche Elek- 
tronentheorie infolge der experimentellen Untersuchungen über die Größen 
2. Ordnung nehmen mußte und denen wir uns sogleich zuwenden werden. 
Die Lorentzsche Formel für die Masse des Elektrons hat dann in der 
Relativitätstheorie eine universelle Bedeutung bekommen; wir kommen auf 
die experimentelle Entscheidung zwischen ihr und der Abrahamschen Theorie 
weiter unten zurück (VI, 7, S. 206). 

Als die Elektronentheorie um die Wende des Jahrhunderts den ge- 
schilderten Stand erreicht hatte, schien die Möglichkeit eines einheitlichen 
physikalischen Weltbildes nahe gerückt, das alle Formen der Energie ein- 
schließlich der mechanischen Trägheit auf dieselbe Wurzel zurückführt, 
das elektromagnetische Feld im Äther. Eine einzige Energieform stand 
noch außerhalb des Systems, die Gravitation; doch durfte man hoffen, 
daß auch diese sich werde als Ätherwirkung verstehen lassen. 

14. Das Experiment von Michelson. 

Aber schon 20 Jahre vorher hatte das Fundament des ganzen Ge- 
bäudes einen Sprung bekommen, und gleichzeitig mit dem Weiterbau 
nach oben mußte man unten stützen und flicken. 

Wir haben mehrmals betont, daß für die Theorie vom ruhenden 
Äther solche Versuche entscheidend sein mußten, bei denen Größen

zweiter Ordnung in ß zu Messung gelangen; hier mußte es sich zeigen, 
ob über einen schnell bewegten Körper der Ätherwind hinfegt und die 
Lichtwellen verweht, wie es die Theorie fordert. 

Das erste und wichtigste Experiment dieser Art gelang Michelson 
(1881) mit Hilfe seines Interferometers (IV, 4, S. 80), das er in unermüd- 
licher Arbeit zu einem Präzisionsinstrument von noch nie dagewesener 
Leistungsfähigkeit ausgebildet hatte. 

Bei der Untersuchung des Einflusses der Erdbewegung auf die Licht- 
geschwindigkeit (IV, 9, S. 102) hat sich ergeben, daß die Zeit, die ein 
Lichtstrahl zum Hin- und Rückwege auf einer der Erdbahn parallelen 
Strecke / gebraucht, nur um eine Größe zweiter Ordnung von dem Werte 
verschieden ist, den sie bei ruhender Erde hätte; wir fanden dort für 
diese Zeit den Ausdruck

wofür man auch schreiben kann:

Könnte man diese Lichtzeit so genau messen, daß man sicher wäre,

zu unterscheiden, so hätte man damit ein Mittel, den Ätherwind nach- 
zuweisen. 

Aber man kann Lichtzeiten an sich keineswegs so genau messen; die 
Interferometermethoden liefern vielmehr nur Differenzen der Laufzeiten 
des Lichtes auf verschiedenen Wegen mit jener erstaunlichen Genauigkeit, 
die für diesen Zweck notwendig ist. 

Daher läßt Michelson einen zweiten /?T ?^ß' 

Lichtstrahl einen Weg AB von derselben 
Länge /, aber senkrecht zur Erdbahn, hin 
und zurück durchlaufen (Abb. 108). Wäh- 
rend das Licht von A nach B läuft, hat / f \ 
sich die Erde ein Stück vorwärts bewegt, 
so daß der Punkt B an die Stelle B' des 
Äthers gelangt ist; der wahre Weg des ^ — ]^ — ^ 
Lichtes im Äther ist also AB'^ und wenn Abb. 108. 
es dazu die Zeit t braucht, so ist AB' = cf. 

In derselben Zeit / hat sich A nach A' mit der Geschwindigkeit v bewegt; 
es ist also AA' = vt. Wendet man nun auf das rechtwinklige Dreieck 
AA' B' den Pythagoräischen Lehrsatz an, so erhält man

Für den Rückweg braucht das Licht ebensolange; denn dabei ver- 
schiebt sich die Erde um dieselbe Strecke, wobei der Ausgangspunkt A 
von A' nach A" gelangt. 

Für den Hin- und Rückweg braucht das Licht also die Zeit:

Der Unterschied der Durchlau fungszeit für dieselbe Strecke parallel 
und senkrecht zur Erdbewegung ist also:

sigung von Gliedern von höherer als 2. Ordnung in ß näherungsweise

Daher kann man mit ausreichender Näherung schreiben: 

Die Verzögerung der einen Lichtwelle gegen die andere ist also eine 
Größe 2. Ordnung. 

Die Messung dieser Verzögerung läßt sich mit Hilfe des Michelson- 
schen Interferometers ausführen (Abb. 109). Bei diesem wird (vgl. S. 80) 
das von der Lichtquelle Q kommende Licht an der halbdurchlässigen 
Platte F in zwei Strahlen geteilt, die senkrecht zueinander bis zu den 
Spiegeln S^ und S^ laufen, dort zurückreflektiert werden und wieder zur 
Platte F gelangen; von hier treten sie vereinigt in das Beobachtungs- 
fernrohr F^ wo sie interferieren. Sind die Abstände S^ P und S^ F gleich,

und bringt man den einen Arm des Apparates in die Richtung der Erd- 
bewegung, so hat man genau den eben erörterten Fall realisiert; die 
beiden Strahlen kommen also im Gesichtsfeld mit einer gegenseitigen 

Verzögerung von — /J^ an. Die Interferenzstreifen liegen also nicht genau 

da, wo sie bei ruhender Erde liegen müßten. Dreht man nun aber den 
Apparat um 90° herum, bis der andere Arm der Erdbewegung parallel 
ist, so werden jetzt die Interferenzstreifen um den gleichen Betrag nach 
der andern Seite verschoben sein.

Beobachtet man also die Lage der

hung des Apparates eine Verschiebung gegeneinander, deren Verhältnis

durch, daß die in etwas verschie-

haben; der Streifenabstand entspricht einem Wegunterschiede von einer 
Wellenlänge, daher ist die beobachtbare Verschiebung der Streifen der

Michelson hat nun bei einer gemeinsam mit Morley(i887) in größerem 
Maßstabe ausgeführten Wiederholung des Versuches die Länge des Lichtweges 
durch mehrfache Hin- und Herreflexion auf 11 m = 1,1 • 10^ cm gebracht; 
die Wellenlänge des benutzten Lichtes betrug etwa Z = 5,9 • io~^ cm. Wir 
wissen, daß ß ungefähr gleich lo^"*, also /5* = io~^ ist; daher wird

d. h. die Interferenzstreifen müssen sich bei der Drehung des Apparates 
um mehr als '/g ihres Abstandes verschieben. Michelson war sicher, daß 
der loo. Teil dieser Verschiebung noch wahrnehmbar sein müsse. 

Als der Versuch aber ausgeführt wurde, zeigte sich nicht die ge- 
ringste Spur der erwarteten Verschiebung, und auch spätere Wieder- 
holungen mit noch raffinierteren Hilfsmitteln gaben kein anderes Resultat. 
Daraus muß geschlossen werden: Der Ätherwind ist nicht vorhanden. 
Die Lichtgeschwindigkeit wird auch in Größen 2. Ordnung von der Be- 
wegung der Erde durch den Äther nicht beeinflußt, 

15. Die Kontraktionshypothese. 

Michelson selbst schloß aus seinem Versuche, daß der Äther von der 
bewegten Erde vollständig mitgeführt werde, wie es die elastische Theorie 
von Stokes und die elektromagnetische von Hertz behaupten. Aber das 
widerspricht den zahlreichen Experimenten, die partielle Mitführung be- 
weisen. Michelson untersuchte nun, ob sich ein Unterschied der Licht- 
geschwindigkeit in verschiedenen Höhen über dem Erdboden feststellen 
lasse, aber ohne positives Ergebnis; er folgerte daraus, daß sich die Be- 
wegung des von der Erde mitgenommenen Äthers in sehr große Höhen 
über der Erdoberfläche erstrecken müsse. Dann würde also der Äther 
von einem bewegten Körper auf beträchtliche Entfernungen beeinflußt; 
aber das ist tatsächlich nicht der Fall, denn Oliver Lodge zeigte (1892), 
daß die Lichtgeschwindigkeit in der Nähe von rasch bewegten Körpern 
nicht im geringsten beeinflußt wird, selbst dann nicht, wenn das Licht in 
einem von dem Körper mitgeführten, starken elektrischen oder magnetischen 
Felde verläuft. Aber alle diese Bemühungen erscheinen fast überflüssig; 
denn hätten sie selbst zu einer einwandfreien Erklärung des Michelsonschen 
Versuches geführt, so bliebe die ganze übrige Elektrodynamik und Optik 
bewegter Körper unerklärt, die durchweg für teilweise Mitführung spricht. 

Ein naheliegender Erklärungsversuch, der aber systematisch erst viel 
später von Ritz (1908) entwickelt worden ist, besteht in der Hypothese, 
daß die Lichtgeschwindigkeit von der Geschwindigkeit der Lichtquelle 
abhängt. Doch steht diese Annahme so ziemlich mit allen theoretischen 
und experimentellen Ergebnissen der Forschung im Widerspruch. Zu- 
nächst würde damit der Charakter der elektromagnetischen Vorgänge als 
Nahwirkung aufgegeben; denn eine solche besteht eben darin, daß die 
Fortpflanzung einer Wirkung von einer Stelle zur andern nur von den 
Vorgängen in der unmittelbaren Nachbarschaft dieser Stelle beeinflußt 
wird, nicht aber von der Geschwindigkeit einer weit entfernten Lichtquelle. 
Ritz hat daher auch offen seine Theorie als eine Art Emissionstheorie 
bezeichnet; aber das Emittierte sollen natürlich keine materiellen, den 
mechanischen Gesetzen gehorchende Teilchen sein, sondern ein Agens, 



Die Kontraktionshypothese. 167 



das beim Eindringen in Materie auf die Elektronen gerichtete, trans- 
versale Kräfte ausübt und diese zum Schwingen bringt. Lichtschwin- 
gungen sind dann also nur in der Materie, nicht im Äther vorhanden. 
Der Einwand, daß für eine Emissionstheorie die Interferenz unerklärlich 
bleibt, ist offenbar bei dieser Auffassung unberechtigt. 

Aber es ist Ritz nicht gelungen, seine Theorie mit den optischen 
und elektromagnetischen Erfahrungen in Einklang zu bringen; überall, wo 
man mit relativen Bewegungen von Lichtquelle und Beobachter zu tun 
hat, zeigen sich zwar Einflüsse auf die Schwingungszahl (Dopplerscher 
Effekt) und auf die Richtung (Aberration), aber nicht auf die Geschwin- 
digkeit des Lichtes (Experimente von Arago, S. 103, und Hoek, S. 104). 
Neuerdings hat de Sitter (191 3) durch eine ausführliche Untersuchung 
bewiesen, daß die Geschwindigkeit des von den Fixsternen kommenden 
Lichtes von der Bewegung dieser Gestirne unabhängig ist. 

Wir haben diese Theorie trotz ihres Mißerfolges erwähnt, weil ein 
Gedanke, den sie betont, auch für das Verständnis der Relativitätstheorie 
wichtig ist; nämlich die Tatsache, daß alle beobachtbaren Vorgänge immer 
an die Materie gebunden sind. Das »Feld im Äther« ist eine Fiktion, 
ersonnen, um die räumlichen und zeitlichen Abhängigkeiten der Vorgänge 
in den Körpern möglichst einfach zu beschreiben. Wir werden nachher 
auf diese Auffassung zurückkommen. 

Wir wenden uns jetzt zur Elektronentheorie von Lorentz zurück, die 
durch das Michelsonsche Experiment offenbar in eine recht schwierige 
Lage geraten mußte. Die Lehre vom ruhenden Äther scheint unabweislich 
die Existenz des Ätherwindes auf der Erde zu fordern und steht daher 
im schärfsten Widerspruch zu Michelsons Versuchsergebnisse. Daß sie 
daran nicht sogleich zugrunde ging, zeigt ihre Stärke, die auf der Ein- 
heitlichkeit und Geschlossenheit ihres physikalischen Weltbildes beruht. 

Schließlich wurde sie auch dieser Schwierigkeit bis zu einem gewissen 
Grade Herr, allerdings durch eine höchst sonderbare Hypothese, mit der Fitz- 
Gerald (1892) hervortrat und die Lorentz sogleich annahm und ausbaute. 

Erinnern wir uns an die Überlegungen, die die Grundlage des Michelson- 
schen Versuches bilden. Wir fanden, daß die Zeit, die ein Lichtstrahl 
zum Hin- und Hergange längs einer Strecke / braucht, verschieden 
ist, je nachdem diese der Erdbewegung parallel oder auf ihr senkrecht

Angenommen nun, der parallel zur Erdbewegung gerichtete Arm des 
Interferometers würde im Verhältnis Vi — ß"^'.!. verkürzt, so würde die

nun einfach so: Jeder Körper^ der gegen den Äther die Geschivmdigkeit v 
hat^ zieht sich in der Beivegungsrichtung um den Bruchteil 



vi-ß'^Yi 



zusammen. 

In der Tat muß dann der Michelsonsche Versuch ein negatives Resultat 
ergeben, denn für beide Stellungen des Interferometers ist dann t^ =4- 
Ferner, und das ist die Hauptsache, wäre eine solche Kontraktion durch 
kein Mittel auf der Erde feststellbar; denn jeder irdische Maßstab würde 
sich ebenso kontrahieren. Ein Beobachter, der außerhalb der Erde im 
Äther ruhte, würde allerdings die Kontraktion bemerken; die ganze Erde 
würde in der Bevvegungsrichtung abgeplattet sein, und alle Dinge darauf 
ebenso. 

Die Kontraktionshypothese erscheint darum so merkwürdig, fast absurd, 
weil die Verkürzung nicht als eine Folge irgendwelcher Kräfte, sondern 
als einfacher Begleitumstand der Tatsache der Bewegung erscheint. Aber 
Lorentz ließ sich durch diesen Einwand nicht abschrecken, sie seiner 
Theorie einzuverleiben, zumal neue Erfahrungen bestätigten, daß auch in 
zweiter Ordnung keine Wirkung der Erdbewegung durch den Äther be- 
obachtet werden kann. 

Wir können alle diese Experimente hier weder beschreiben, noch gar 
im einzelnen diskutieren. Sie sind teils optisch und betreffen die Vorgänge 
bei der Spiegelung und Brechung, der Doppelbrechung, der Drehung der 
Polarisationsebene usw., teils sind sie elektromagnetisch und betreffen die 
Induktionserscheinungen, die Stromverteilung in Drähten usw. Die physi- 
kalische Technik gestattet heute festzustellen, ob bei diesen Vorgängen 
ein Einfluß zweiter Ordnung der Erdbewegung vorhanden ist oder nicht. 
Besonders beachtenswert ist ein Versuch von Trouton und Noble (1903) 
zur Auffindung einer Drehkraft, die an einem aufgehängten Plattenkonden- 
sator infolge des Ätherwindes auftreten sollte. 

Diese Experimente fielen ausnahmslos negativ aus. Man durfte nicht 
mehr daran zweifeln, daß eine Translationsbewegung durch den Äther 
vom mitbewegten Beobachter nicht wahrgenommen werden kann. Das 
Relativitätsprinzip, das für die Mechanik gilt, erstreckt also seine Gültig- 
keit auf die Gesamtheit aller elektromagnetischen Vorgänge. 

Nun ging Lorentz daran, diese Tatsache mit seiner Äthertheorie in 
Einklang zu bringen; und dazu schien kein anderer Weg vorhanden als 
die Annahme der Kontraktionshypothese und ihre Verarbeitung mit den 
Gesetzen der Elektronentheorie zu einem widerspruchslosen, einheitlichen 
Ganzen. Zunächst bemerkte er, daß ein System elektrischer Ladungen, 
die sich allein unter der Wirkung ihrer elektrostatischen Kräfte im Gleich- 
gewichte halten, sich von selbst kontrahiert, sobald es in Bewegung gesetzt 
wird; genauer gesagt, die bei der gleichförmigen Bewegung des Systems 



Die Kontraktionshypothese. lÖQ 

auftretenden elektromagnetischen Kräfte verändern die Gleichgewichts- 
konfiguration so, daß jede Länge in der Bewegungsrichtung um den Faktor 
Vi — ß^ verkürzt wird. 

Dieser mathematische Satz führt nun zu einer Erklärung der Kontraktion, 
wenn man annimmt, daß alle physikalischen Kräfte im Grunde elektrischen 
Ursprungs sind oder wenigstens dieselben Gesetze des Gleichgewichts in 
gleichförmig bewegten Systemen befolgen. Die Schwierigkeit, alle Kräfte 
als elektrische anzusehen, beruht darauf, daß diese nach altbekannten 
Sätzen, die schon von Gauß stammen, zwar zu Gleichgewichten, aber 
niemals zu stabilen Gleichgewichten von Ladungen führen. Die Kräfte, 
die die Atome zu Molekeln und diese zu festen Körpern verbinden, können 
daher nicht einfach elektrisch sein. Am klarsten tritt die Notwendigkeit 
der Annahme von nichtelektrischen Kräften hervor, wenn man nach der 
dynamischen Konstitution des einzelnen Elektrons selbst fragt. Dieses 
soll eine Anhäufung negativer Ladung sein; man muß dieser eine endliche 
Ausdehnung zuschreiben, denn wie wir (S. i6o) gesehen haben, ist die 

Energie einer kugelförmigen Ladung vom Radius a gleich \ — und wird 

a 

unendlich groß, wenn a gleich Null gesetzt wird. Die einzelnen Teile 

des Elektrons streben aber auseinander, da gleichnamige Ladungen sich 

abstoßen. Folglich muß eine fremde Kraft da sein, die sie zusammenhält. 

In der Abrahamschen Theorie des Elektrons wird angenommen, daß dieses 

eine starre Kugel sei; d. h. die nichtelektrischen Kräfte sollen so groß 

sein, daß sie überhaupt keine Deformation zulassen. Man kann aber 

natürlich auch andere Annahmen machen. 

Für Lorentz lag nun die Hypothese nahe, daß auch das Elektron die 
Kontraktion Vi — ß^ erfährt; wir haben bereits oben (S. 162) gesagt, 
daß sich dann eine viel einfachere Formel für die Masse des Elektrons 
ergibt, als nach der Abrahamschen Hypothese. Das Lorentzsche Elektron 
hat aber außer der elektromagnetischen Energie noch eine Deformations- 
energie fremden Ursprungs, die bei dem starren Elektron von Abraham fehlt. 

Lorentz untersuchte nun die Frage, ob die Kontraktionshypothese zur 
Ableitung der Relativität genügt. In schwierigen Rechnungen stellte er 
fest, daß das nicht der Fall sei; aber er fand auch (1899), welche An- 
nahme noch hinzukommen muß, damit alle elektromagnetischen Vorgänge 
in bewegten Systemen ebenso ablaufen wie im Äther. Sein Resultat ist 
zum mindesten ebenso merkwürdig, wie die Kontraktionshypothese; es 
lautet : Man muß in einem gleichförmig bewegten Systeme ein anderes Zeitmaß 
verwenden. Er nannte dieses von System zu System verschiedene Zeit- 
maß •» Ortszeit <■. Die Kontraktionshypothese kann man offenbar so aus- 
sprechen, daß das Längenmaß in bewegten Systemen anders ist als im 
Äther. Beide Hypothesen zusammen besagen nun, daß Raum und Zeit 
in bewegten Systemen anders gemessen werden müssen als im Äther. 
Lorentz gab die Gesetze an, nach denen die Maßgrößen in verschieden 
bewegten Systemen aufeinander umgerechnet werden können, und bewies. 



lyo Die Grundgesetze der Elektrodynamik. 

daß bei diesen Transformationen die Feldgleichungen der Elektronen- 
theorie unverändert bleiben. Das ist der mathematische Gehalt seiner 
Entdeckung; zu ähnlichen Ergebnissen gelangten fast zur gleichen Zeit^) 
der englische Physiker Larmor (1900) und der französische Mathematiker 
Poincard (1905). Wir werden diese Zusammenhänge sogleich von Ein- 
steins Standpunkte in viel durchsichtigerer Form kennenlernen und gehen 
daher hier nicht darauf ein. Aber wir wollen uns klarmachen, welche 
Folgen die neue Wendung der Lorentzschen Theorie für die Vorstellung 
vom Äther hat. 

In der neuen Theorie von Lorentz gilt in Übereinstimmung mit der 
Erfahrung das Relativitätsprinzip für alle elektrodynamischen Vorgänge; 
ein Beobachter nimmt also in seinem System dieselben Vorgänge wahr, 
mag dieses im Äther ruhen oder in geradlinig, gleichförmiger Bewegung 
begriffen sein. Er besitzt also überhaupt kein Mittel, das eine vom andern 
zu unterscheiden; denn auch die Beobachtung von andern Körpern in der 
Welt, die sich unabhängig von ihm bewegen, lehrt ihn immer nur die 
Relativbewegung gegen diese kennen, niemals die absolute Bewegung 
gegen den Äther. Er kann also behaupten, daß er selber im Äther ruhe, 
ohne daß jemand ihn widerlegen kann. Allerdings kann ein zweiter Be- 
obachter auf einem andern, relativ zum ersten bewegten Körper mit dem- 
selben Rechte dasselbe behaupten. Es gibt kein empirisches oder theo- 
retisches Mittel, zu entscheiden, ob einer von beiden und welcher recht hat. 

Wir gelangen hier also in dieselbe Lage gegenüber dem Äther, in die 
uns das klassische Relativitätsprinzip der Mechanik gegenüber dem abso- 
luten Räume Newtons brachte (III. 6, S. 56). Dort müßten wir zugeben, 
daß es sinnlos sei, einen bestimmten Ort im absoluten Räume als etwas 
Wirkliches im Sinne der Physik anzuerkennen; denn es gibt kein mecha- 
nisches Mittel einen Ort im absoluten Räume zu fixieren oder wiederzu- 
finden. Genau so muß man jetzt zugestehen, daß eine bestimmte Stelle 
im Äther nichts physikalisch Wirkliches ist; damit verliert aber der Äther 
selbst vollkommen den Charakter einer Substanz. Ja, man darf sogar 
sagen: Wenn von zwei relativ zueinander bewegten Beobachtern jeder das 
gleiche Recht hat zu behaupten, er ruhe im Äther, so kann es gar keinen 
Äther geben. 

Die Äthertheorie führt also in ihrer höchsten Entwicklung zur Auf- 
hebung ihres Grundbegriffes. Aber man hat sich nur schwer dazu ent- 
schließen können, die Leerheit der Äther Vorstellung zuzugeben; selbst 
Lorentz, dessen geistvolle Gedanken und mühevolle Arbeit die Äther- 
theorie bis zu dieser Kjrisis geführt haben, hat sich längere Zeit vor diesem 
Schritte gescheut. Der Grund dafür ist der: Man hat den Äther eigens 
dafür erdacht, damit ein Träger der Lichtschwingungen oder allgemeiner der 



I) Es ist historisch interessant, daß die heute als Lorentz-Transformation [s. VI, 
2, S. 180, Formel (72)] bezeichneten Formeln für die Umrechnung auf ein bewegtes 
System schon 1887 von Voigt in einer Abhandlung aufgestellt worden sind, die noch 
auf dem Boden der elastischen Lichttheorie steht. 



Die Kontraktionshypothese. i y i 



elektromagnetischen Kräfte im leeren Räume vorhanden ist. Schwingungen 
ohne etwas, was schwingt, sind in der Tat undenkbar. Wir haben aber 
schon oben, bei Besprechung der Ritzschen Theorie, darauf hingewiesen, 
daß die Behauptung, auch im leeren Räume seien feststellbare Schwingungen 
vorhanden, über jede mögliche Erfahrung hinausgeht. Licht oder elektro- 
magnetische Kräfte sind immer nur an der Materie nachweisbar; der leere, 
von der Materie völlig freie Raum ist überhaupt kein Gegenstand der 
Beobachtung. Feststellbar ist nur: Von diesem materiellen Körper geht 
eine Wirkung aus und trifft an jenem materiellen Körper einige Zeit 
später ein. Was dazwischen geschieht, ist rein hypothetisch, oder, schärfer 
ausgedrückt, willkürlich; das bedeutet, die Theorie darf das Vakuum mit 
Zustandsgrößen, Feldern oder dergleichen nach freiem Ermessen ausstatten, 
mit der einzigen Einschränkung, daß dadurch die an materiellen Körpern 
beobachteten Veränderungen in einen straffen, durchsichtigen Zusammen- 
hang gebracht werden. 

Diese Auffassung ist ein neuer Schritt in der Richtung nach höherer 
Abstraktion, nach Loslösung von gewohnten Anschauungen, die scheinbar 
notwendige Bestandteile der Vorstellungswelt sind. Zugleich ist sie aber 
eine Annäherung an das Ideal, nur das durch die Erfahrung direkt Ge- 
gebene als Baustein der physikalischen Welt gelten zu lassen, unter Aus- 
merzung aller überflüssigen Bilder und Analogien, die einem Zustande 
primitiverer und roherer Erfahrung entstammen. 

Der substantielle Äther verschwindet von jetzt an aus der Theorie. 
An seine Stelle tritt das abstrakte »elektromagnetische Feld« als bloßes 
mathematisches Hilfsmittel zur bequemeren Beschreibung der Vorgänge 
in der Materie und ihrer gesetzmäßigen Zusammenhänge^). 

Wer vor einer solchen formalen Auffassung zurückschreckt, denke an 
folgende, ganz analoge Abstraktion, an die er sich längst gewöhnt hat: 

Zur Ortsbestimmung auf dem Erdboden werden auf Kirchtürmen, 
Bergspitzen und anderen, sichtbaren Punkten trigonometrische Zeichen 
angebracht, auf denen die geographische Länge und Breite verzeichnet 
sind. Auf dem Meere aber ist nichts davon vorhanden; dort sind die 
Längen- und Breitenkreise nur gedacht, oder, wie man auch sagt, virtuell. 
Wenn ein Schiff seinen Ort feststellen will, so verwandelt es einen Schnitt- 
punkt dieser gedachten Linien durch astronomische Beobachtungen in 
Wirklichkeit, den virtuellen Ort in einen reellen. Ganz ähnlich ist das 
elektromagnetische Feld aufzufassen. Der feste Erdboden entspricht der 
Materie, die trigonometrischen Marken den feststellbaren physikalischen 
Veränderungen. Das Meer aber entspricht dem Vakuum, die Längen- 



I) Einstein hat neuerdings vorgeschlagen, den leeren, mit Gravitations- und elektro- 
magnetischen Feldern ausgestattet gedachten Raum >Äther^ zu nennen, wobei aber 
dieses Wort keine Substanz mit deren traditionellen Attributen bezeichnen soll; so 
gibt es in diesem >Äther« keine fixierbaren Punkte und es ist sinnlos von Bewegung 
relativ zum »Äther« zu sprechen. Ein solcher Gebrauch des Wortes Äther ist natür- 
lich zulässig und, wenn einmal eingebürgert, wohl auch bequem.

und Breitenkreise dem gedachten elektromagnetischen Felde. Dieses ist 
virtuell, bis ein Probekörper hereingebracht wird und es durch seine 
reellen Veränderungen sichtbar macht; geradeso wie das Schiff den vir- 
tuellen geographischen Ort realisiert. 

Nur wer diese Betrachtungsweise sich wirklich angeeignet hat, wird 
die weitere Entwicklung der Lehre von Raum und Zeit verstehen. Ver- 
schiedene Menschen sind der fortschreitenden Abstraktion, Objektivierung 
und Relativierung verschieden zugänglich. Die alten Kulturvölker des 
europäischen Kontinents, Deutsche, Holländer, Skandinavier, Franzosen 
und Italiener, nehmen sie am leichtesten auf und sind am lebhaftesten 
am Weiterbau des Systems beteiligt. Die Engländer, die zu konkreten 
Vorstellungen neigen, sind schon schwerer zugänglich. Der Amerikaner 
hält sich gern an mechanische Bilder und Modelle; selbst Michelson, 
dessen experimentelle Arbeiten den größten Anteil an der Zerstörung der 
Äthertheorie haben, lehnt eine ätherlose Lichttheorie als undenkbar ab. 
Aber die junge Generation wird überall schon im Sinne der neuen Auf- 
fassungen erzogen und nimmt das als Selbstverständlichkeiten hin, was 
den Älteren als unerhörte Neuerung gilt. 

Überblicken wir die Entwicklung, so sehen wir die Äthertheorie mit 
dem Relativitätsprinzip abschließen und durch dieses ihr Ende finden. 
Der substantielle Äther verschwindet als überflüssige Hypothese, das Rela- 
tivitätsprinzip tritt um so klarer als Grundgesetz der Physik hervor. 
Daher entsteht die Aufgabe, von dieser sicheren Grundlage aus das Ge- 
bäude der physikalischen Welt neu aufzubauen. Wir kommen damit end- 
lich zu Einsteins Arbeiten. 



VI. Das spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

I. Der Begriff der Gleichzeitigkeit. 

Die logischen Schwierigl^eiten, die bei der Durchführung des Rela- 
tivitätsprinzips auf die elektrodynamischen Vorgänge zu überwinden waren, 
beruhen darauf, daß folgende zwei Sätze in Einklang zu bringen sind: 

1. Nach der klassischen Mechanik hat die Geschwindigkeit irgend- 
einer Bewegung verschiedene Werte für zwei relativ zueinander 
bewegte Beobachter. 

2. Die Erfahrung aber lehrt, daß die Lichtgeschwindigkeit unabhängig 
von dem Bewegungszustande des Beobachters immer denselben 
Wert c hat. 

Die ältere Äthertheorie versuchte, den Widerspruch der beiden Sätze 
dadurch fortzuschaffen, daß die Lichtgeschwindigkeit in zwei Summanden 
geteilt wurde, die Geschwindigkeit des Lichtäthers und die Geschwindig- 
keit des Lichtes gegen den Äther, wobei der erste Anteil noch durch Mit- 
führungshypothesen geeignet bestimmt werden konnte. Hierdurch gelingt 
aber die Aufhebung des Widerspruchs nur bezüglich Größen i. Ordnung. 
Die Lorentzsche Theorie mußte, um den Satz von der Konstanz der 
Lichtgeschwindigkeit streng aufrecht zu erhalten, für jedes bewegte System 
ein besonderes Längen- und Zeitmaß einführen; der Satz kommt dann 
also durch eine Art »physikalischer Täuschung« zustande. 

Einstein erkannte (1905), daß es sich bei der Lorentzschen Längen- 
kontraktion und Ortszeit nicht um einen mathematischen Kunstgriff und 
eine physikalische Täuschung handelt, sondern um die Grundlagen der 
Begriffe von Raum und Zeit überhaupt. 

Von den beiden Sätzen i. und 2. ist der erste rein theoretischer, 
begrifflicher Art, der zweite empirisch begründet. 

Da nun der zweite, der Satz von der Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindig- 
keit, als experimentell ganz sicher gelten muß, so bleibt nichts übrig als 
den ersten Satz fallen zu lassen und damit die Prinzipien der Raum- und 
Zeitbestimmung, wie sie bisher immer gehandhabt worden sind. Es muß 
also in diesen ein Fehler stecken, zum mindesten ein Vorurteil, eine Ver- 
wechslung von Gewohntem mit Denknotwendigem, jenem bekannten 
Hindernisse jeglichen Fortschrittes. 

Dieses Vorurteil nun steckt in dem Begriffe der Gleichzeitigkeit. 

Es gilt als selbstverständlich, daß der Satz einen Sinn hat: Ein Er- 
eignis an der Stelle A^ etwa auf der Erde, und ein Ereignis an der 



174 Das spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

Stelle B^ etwa auf der Sonne, sind gleichzeitig. Man setzt dabei vor- 
aus, daß Begrififen wie Zeitmoment, Gleichzeitigkeit, früher, später usw. 
eine Bedeutung an sich, a priori, gültig für das Weltganze, zukommt. 
Auf diesem Standpunkte war auch Newton, als er die Existenz einer 
absoluten Zeit oder Dauer postulierte (III, i, S. 45), die »gleichförmig und 
ohne Beziehung auf irgendeinen äußeren Gegenstand« verfließen soll. 

Aber für den messenden Physiker ist jedenfalls eine solche Zeit nicht 
vorhanden. Für ihn hat der Satz, ein Ereignis bei A und ein Ereignis 
bei B seien gleichzeitig, schlechthin keinen Sinn; denn er besitzt kein 
Mittel, um über die Richtigkeit oder Falschheit der Behauptung zu ent- 
scheiden. 

Um nämlich die Gleichzeitigkeit zweier Ereignisse, die an verschiedenen 
Orten stattfinden, beurteilen zu können, muß man an jedem Orte Uhren 
haben, von denen man sicher ist, daß sie gleich gehen oder »synchron« 
sind. Die Frage läuft also auf die heraus: Kann man ein Mittel an- 
geben, um den gleichen Gang zweier an verschiedenen Orten befindlicher 
Uhren zu prüfen? 

Wir denken uns die beiden Uhren im festen Abstände / bei A und B 
in einem Bezugsysteme *S ruhend. Man kann nun die Uhren auf zwei 
Weisen auf gleichen Gang bringen: 

1. Man trägt sie an dieselbe Stelle, reguliert sie dort, bis sie richtig 
gehen, und bringt sie dann nach A und B zurück. 

2. Man benutzt Zeitsignale zur Uhrvergleichung. 

Beide Verfahren werden in der Praxis verwandt; ein Seeschiff führt 
einen gutgehenden Chronometer mit, der nach der Normaluhr im Heimat- 
hafen reguliert ist, außerdem aber bekommt es Zeitsignale mit drahtloser 
Telegraphie. 

Daß man letztere für nötig hält, beweist das Mißtrauen, welches man 
gegen die »mitgenommene« Zeit hat. Die praktische Schwäche des Ver- 
fahrens der transportabeln Uhr besteht darin, daß der kleinste Fehler 
im Gange sich dauernd vergrößert. Aber auch wenn man die Annahme 
macht, daß es ideale, fehlerfreie Uhren gibt (wie sie der Physiker in den 
Atomschwingungen bei der Lichtaussendung zu besitzen überzeugt ist), 
so ist es logisch unzulässig, die Zeitdefinition in relativ zueinander be- 
wegten Systemen auf diese zu stützen. Denn direkt, d. h. ohne Ver- 
mittelung von Signalen, prüfbar ist doch der gleiche Gang zweier Uhren, 
seien sie noch so gut, nur, wenn sie relativ zueinander ruhen; daß sie 
auch bei relativer Bewegung den gleichen Gang behalten, ist (ohne Si- 
gnale) nicht feststellbar; es wäre eine reine Hypothese, die wir nach den 
Prinzipien physikalischer Forschung zu vermeiden suchen müssen. Da- 
durch wird man dazu gedrängt, das Verfahren der Zeitsignale für die 
Definition der Zeit in relativ bewegten Systemen zu bevorzugen; wenn 
man damit zu einem widerspruchsfreien System der Zeitmessung gelangt, 
wird man nachträglich zu untersuchen haben, wie eine ideale Uhr be- 



Der Begriff der Gleichzeitigkeit. 175 



schaffen sein muß, damit sie in beliebig bewegten Systemen immer die 
»richtige« Zeit anzeigt (s. VI, 5, S. 189). 

Stellen wir uns einen Schleppzug auf See vor, bestehend aus einem 
Schleppdampfer A und einigen an gespannter Trosse geschleppten Fracht- 
kähnen B^ C, D. Es sei Windstille und so dichter Nebel, daß ein Schiff 
vom andern nicht sichtbar ist; sollen nun die Uhren auf den Schiffen 
verglichen werden, so wird man Schallsignale benutzen. Der Schlepper 
A wird etwa um 12 Uhr einen Schuß lösen, und wenn der Knall auf 
den Kähnen hörbar ist, so werden diese ihre Uhren auf 12 Uhr stellen. 
Hierbei begehen sie aber offenbar einen kleinen Fehler, da ja der Schall 
eine gewisse Zeit braucht, um von A nach B^ C . . . zu gelangen. Wenn 
die Schallgeschwindigkeit c bekannt ist, so kann man diesen Fehler be- 
seitigen, c ist etwa gleich 340 m/sec; wenn der Kahn B um /= 170 m 

/ 170 
hinter A ist. so braucht der Schall / = — = = ~ sec von A nach 

c 340 

B^ die Uhr bei B muß daher bei Eintreffen des Schalles auf \ sec nach 
12 Uhr gestellt werden. Aber auch die Korrektion ist nur richtig, wenn 
der Schleppzug still liegt; sobald er fährt, braucht offenbar der Schall von 
A nach B kürzere Zeit, weil der Kahn B der Schallwelle entgegenkommt. 
Wenn man jetzt die genaue Korrektion anbringen will, so muß man die 
absolute Geschwindigkeit der Schiffe gegen die Luft kennen. Ist diese 
unbekannt, so ist auch eine absolute Zeitvergleichung mit Hilfe des 
Schalles unmöglich. Bei sichtigem Wetter kann man das Licht statt des 
Schalles benutzen; da dieses ungeheuer viel schneller läuft, ist der Fehler 
jedenfalls sehr klein, aber bei einer prinzipiellen Betrachtung kommt es 
auf die absolute Größe natürlich gar nicht an. Denken wir uns statt des 
Schleppzuges auf See einen Weltkörper im Äthermeer, statt des Schall- 
signals ein Lichtsignal, so bleiben doch alle Überlegungen ungeändert 
bestehen. Einen schnelleren Boten als das Licht aber gibt es im Welten- 
raume nicht. Wir sehen, daß die Theorie vom absolut ruhenden Äther zu 
dem Schlüsse führt: eine absolute Zeitvergleichung in bewegten Systemen 
ist nur ausführbar, wenn man die Bewegung gegen den Äther kennt. 

Aber das Resultat aller experimentellen Forschungen war, daß eine 
Bewegung gegen den Äther durch keine physikalische Beobachtung fest- 
stellbar ist. Daraus folgt, daß absolute Gleichzeitigkeit ebenfalls auf keine 
Weise festgestellt werden kann. 

Das Paradoxe dieses Satzes verschwindet, wenn man sich klar macht, 
daß man zur Zeitvergleichung mit Lichtsignalen den genauen Wert der 
Lichtgeschwindigkeit schon kennen muß, daß aber die Messung dieser 
wiederum auf die Bestimmung einer Zeitdauer herausläuft. Hier liegt 
offenbar ein logischer Zirkel vor. 

Kann man nun auch keine absolute Gleichzeitigkeit erreichen, so läßt 
sich doch, wie Einstein bemerkt hat, eine relative Gleichzeitigkeit für alle 
in relativer Ruhe zueinander befindlichen Uhren definieren, wobei der 
Wert der Signalgeschwindigkeit nicht bekannt zu sein braucht. 



1^5 Das spezielle Emsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



Wir wollen dies zunächst an unserm Schleppzuge zeigen. Wenn dieser 
ruht, so wird der gleiche Gang der auf den Schiffen A und B befind- 
lichen Uhren (Abb. in) folgendermaßen erreicht werden können: man 
bringt ein Boot C genau in die Mitte der Schleppleine zwischen A und B 
und läßt dort einen Schuß abgeben; dann muß der Knall bei A und B 
gleichzeitig gehört werden. 

Wenn nun der Schleppzug S fährt, so kann man offenbar genau 
dasselbe Verfahren anwenden; wenn die Schiffer nicht daran denken, daß 
sie relativ zur Luft in Bewegung sind, so werden sie überzeugt sein, daß 
die Uhren in A und B gleich gehen. 

Ein zweiter Schleppzug S\ dessen Schiffe A' , B' ^ C in genau den- 
selben Abständen voneinander liegen wie die entsprechenden des ersten 
S^ möge seine Uhren auf dieselbe Art vergleichen. Wenn jetzt der eine 
Zug den andern überholt, mag dieser nun ruhen oder selber fahren, so 
werden in einem Augenblicke die Schiffe A an A\ B an B' vorüber- 
gleiten, und die Schiffer können prüfen, 
/ ob ihre Uhren übereinstimmen. Natürlich 

/ ^ ^ 

H y:^ H werden sie finden, daß das nicht der Fall 

.,, ist; wenn etwa A und Ä zufällig syn- 

Abb. III. ' . , , . , 

chron sind, so smd es B und B nicht. 

Dadurch wird der Fehler zutage kommen; bei Fahrt braucht offenbar 
das Signal vom Mittelpunkte C nach dem vorderen Schiffe A längere, 
nach dem hinteren Schiffe B kürzere Zeit als in Ruhe, weil A vor 
der Schallwelle flieht, B ihr entgegenkommt; und dieser Unterschied 
ist verschieden, wenn die Geschwindigkeiten der beiden Züge ver- 
schieden sind. 

Im Falle des Schalles hat nun ein System die richtige Zeit, nämhch 
das relativ zur Luft ruhende. Im Falle des Lichtes aber besteht keine 
Möglichkeit, das zu behaupten, weil absolute Bewegung gegen den Licht- 
äther ein Begriff ist, der nach allen Erfahrungen keine physikalische 
Realität hat. Das am Beispiel des Schalles erörterte Verfahren zur Uhr- 
regulierung ist natürlich auch mit Licht möglich ; die in A und B be- 
findlichen Uhren werden so gestellt, daß jeder vom Mitelpunkt C der 
Strecke AB ausgehende Lichtblitz die Uhren in A und B bei gleicher 
Stellung ihrer Zeiger erreicht. Auf diese Weise kann jedes System S 
den Synchronismus seiner Uhren herstellen; wenn sich aber zwei solche, 
gleichförmig und geradlinig gegeneinander bewegte Systeme begegnen und 
etwa die Uhren A^ Ä übereinstimmen, so werden die Uhren B, B' ver- 
schiedene Zeigerstellungen haben. Beide Systeme können mit gleichem 
Rechte beanspruchen, die richtige Zeit zu haben; denn jedes kann be- 
haupten, daß es ruht, weil alle Naturgesetze in beiden gleichlauten. 

Wenn aber zwei mit gleichem Rechte denselben Anspruch erheben, 
der seinem Sinne nach nur einem zukommen kann, so muß man schließen, 
daß der Anspruch überhaupt sinnlos ist: 

Es gibt keine absolute Gleichzeitigkeit, 



Der Begriff der Gleichzeitigkeit. 



177 




Wer das einmal begriffen hat, dem ist es schwer verständlich, daß 
viele Jahrhunderte exakter Forschung vergehen mußten, bis diese einfache 
Tatsache erkannt wurde. Es ist die alte Geschichte vom Ei des Co- 
lumbus. 

Die nächste Frage ist die, ob die Methode der Uhrvergleichung, die 
wir eingeführt haben, zu einem widerspruchslosen relativen Zeitbegriffe 
führt. 

Das ist tatsächlich der Fall. Wir wollen, um das einzusehen, die Min- 
kowskische Darstellung der Ereignisse oder Weltpunkte in einer xt-Ehene be- 
nützen, wobei wir uns auf Bewegungen 
in der ^-Richtung beschränken und da- 
her y und z fortlassen (Abb. 112). 

Die auf der jc- Achse ruhenden 
Punkte A, B, C werden in dem xt- 
Koordinatensystem S als 3 Parallele 
zur /-Achse dargestellt. Der Punkt C 
liege in der Mitte zwischen A und B. 
Von ihm soll zur Zeit / = o ein Licht- 
signal nach beiden Richtungen aus- 
gesandt werden. 

Wir nehmen an, daß das System 5 >ruhe«, d. h. daß die Lichtge- 
schwindigkeit nach beiden Richtungen gleich sei; dann werden die nach 
rechts und links eilenden Lichtsignale durch Gerade dargestellt, die 
gegen die A:-Achse gleich geneigt sind und die wir > Lichtlinien*- nennen. 
Die Neigung wollen wir gleich 45° annehmen, was offenbar darauf her- 
ausläuft, daß dieselbe Strecke, die in der Figur die Längeneinheit i cm 
auf der :jf- Achse darstellt, auf 
der /-Achse die sehr kleine Zeit j/ 

— sec bedeutet, die das Licht 
c 

zum Durchlaufen von i cm Weg 
braucht. 

Die Schnittpunkte A^^ B^ der 
Lichtlinien mit den Weltlinien der 
Punkte A^ B geben durch ihre 
/-Werte die Momente des Ein- 
treffens der beiden Lichtsignale 
an. Man sieht, daß A^ und B^ 
auf einer Parallelen zur ;c-Achse 
liegen, also gleichzeitig sind. 

Jetzt sollen die 3 Punkte A^ B^ C gleichförmig mit gleicher Ge- 
schwindigkeit bewegt sein ; ihre Weltlinien sind dann wieder parallel, aber 
geneigt gegen die :c- Achse (Abb. 113). Die Lichtsignale werden durch 
dieselben von C ausgehenden Lichtlinien wie oben dargestellt; aber ihre 
Schnittpunkte ^j , B\ mit den Weltlinien A^ B liegen jetzt nicht auf 

Born, Relativitätstheorie, 3. Aufl. 12 




lyg I^^s spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

einer Parallelen zur :c- Achse, sie sind also im :5c /-Koordinatensysteme 
nicht gleichzeitig, sondern B\ ist später als A\. Dagegen wird ein mit- 
bevvegter Beobachter mit gleichem Rechte behaupten, daß Ä^^ B\ gleich- 
zeitige Ereignisse (Weltpunkte) sind ; er wird ein ^ /-Koordinatensystem S' 
gebrauchen, bei dem die Punkte ^j, B\ auf einer Parallelen zur ^-Achse 
liegen. Die Weltlinien der Punkte A^ B^ C selbst sind natürlich der 
/-Achse parallel, weil A^ B^ C im Systeme S' ruhen, ihre ^'-Koordinaten 
für alle / denselben Wert haben. 

Daraus ergibt sich, daß das mitbewegte System *S" in der :x: /-Ebene 
durch ein schiefwinkliges Koordinatensystem x' t^ dargestellt wird, bei dem 
beide Achsen gegen die ursprünglichen geneigt sind. 

Wir erinnern uns nun daran, daß in der gewöhnlichen Mechanik die 
Inertialsysteme in der ä^ /-Ebene ebenfalls durch schiefwinklige Koordinaten 
mit beliebig gerichteter /-Achse dargestellt werden, wobei aber die 
a:- Achse immer dieselbe bleibt (III, 7, S. 60). Wir haben schon dort dar- 
auf hingewiesen, daß dies vom mathematischen Standpunkte ein Schön- 
heitsfehler ist, der durch die Relativitätstheorie aufgehoben wird. Jetzt 
sieht man klar, wie das durch die neue Definition der Gleichzeitigkeit 
zustande kommt. Zugleich gewinnt man durch den Anblick der Figur 
auch ohne Rechnung die Überzeugung, daß diese Definition in sich wider- 
spruchslos möglich sein muß; denn sie bedeutet ja nichts anderes als 
den Gebrauch schiefwinkliger ^/-Koordinaten statt rechtwinkliger. 

Die Einheiten der Länge und der Zeit in dem schiefwinkligen System 
werden durch die Konstruktion noch nicht bestimmt; bei dieser ist nur 
die Tatsache benützt, daß das Licht sich nach allen Richtungen in einem 
System S gleich schnell ausbreitet, aber noch nicht der Satz, daß die 
Lichtgeschwindigkeit in allen Inertialsystemen denselben Wert c hat. Zieht 
man diesen noch heran, so gewinnt man die vollständige Kinematik 
Einsteins. 

2. Die Einsteinsche Kinematik und die Lorentz- 
Transformationen. 

Wir wiederholen noch einmal die Voraussetzungen der Einsteinschen 
Kinematik : 

1. Das Relativitätsprinzip: Es gibt unendlich viele, relativ gleich- 
förmig und geradlinig bewegte Bezugsysteme (Inertialsysteme), in 
denen alle Naturgesetze ihre einfachste (ursprünglich für den ab- 
soluten Raum oder ruhenden Äther abgeleitete) Gestalt annehmen. 

2. Das Prinzip von der Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindigkeit: In allen 
Inertialsystemen hat die Lichtgeschwindigkeit, mit physikalisch 
gleichartigen Maßstäben und Uhren gemessen, denselben Wert. 

Die Aufgabe ist, daraus die Beziehungen zwischen Längen und Zeiten 
in den verschiedenen Inertialsystemen abzuleiten. Dabei beschränken 
wir uns wieder auf Bewegungen parallel zu einer festen Raumrichtung, 
der ^v-Richtung. 



Die Einsteinsche Kinematik und die Lorentz-Transformationen. lyg 

Wir betrachten zwei Inertialsysteme S und S'j die die relative Ge- 
schwindigkeit V haben. Der Nullpunkt des Systems S' hat also bezüglich 
des Systems S zur Zeit / die Koordinate x =^ vt\ seine Weltlinie ist im 
Systeme S' durch die- Bedingung x' = o gekennzeichnet. Die beiden Glei- 
chungen müssen dasselbe bedeuten , es muß daher x — vi mit x pro- 
portional sein; wir setzen: 

ax ^:= X — Vf. 

Nach dem Relativitätsprinzip sind aber beide Systeme völlig gleich- 
berechtigt; man kann also dieselbe Überlegung auf die Bewegung des 
Nullpunkts von S relativ zu S' anwenden, wobei nur die relative Ge- 
schwindigkeit V das umgekehrte Vorzeichen hat. Es muß daher auch 
x' -\-vt' mit X proportional sein, und zwar wegen der Gleichwertigkeit 
der beiden Systeme mit demselben Proportionalitätsfaktor a: 

ax = x' -\- vt' , 

Aus dieser Gleichung läßt sich nun mit Hilfe der ersten t' durch x 
und / ausdrücken; man findet 



also 



vt' = ax — jc' = ax = — {{a^ — i) ^ + z'^l » 

a a ' 



at = X -\- t . 



Diese Gleichung zusammen mit der ersten erlaubt x und / zu be- 
rechnen, wenn x und / bekannt sind. Dabei ist aber noch der Propor- 
tionalitätsfaktor a unbestimmt; dieser muß so gewählt werden, daß das 
Prinzip von der Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindigkeit gewahrt wird. 

Die Geschwindigkeit einer gleichförmigen Bewegung wird im System S

durch « = — , im System *S' durch u' = —r dargestellt. Dividiert man 

die beiden Gleichungen, welche x und t' durch x und / auszudrücken 
gestatten, ineinander, so hebt sich der Faktor a fort und man findet

Man nennt diese Regeln, nach denen Ort und Zeit eines Weltpunktes 
im System S' berechnet werden können, wenn sie im System S gegeben 
sind, eine Lorentz-Transformation. Es sind tatsächlich dieselben Formeln, 
die Lorentz durch schwierige Überlegungen über die Invarianz der Max- 
wellschen Feldgleichungen gefunden hat (s. V, i5_, S. 169). 

Will man x^y^z^t durch x ^ y\ z\ t' ausdrücken, so muß man die 
Gleichungen auflösen; man kann ohne Rechnung aus der Gleichwertigkeit 
der beiden Systeme S und S' schließen, daß die Auflösungsformeln genau 
dieselbe Gestalt haben müssen, wobei nur v m — v verwandelt ist. In 
der Tat ergibt auch die Ausrechnung:

Von besonderem Interesse ist der Grenzfall, daß die Geschwindig-

erhält man aus (72)

Man versteht so, daß wegen des kleinen Wertes, den — in den 

meisten praktischen Fällen hat, die Galileische Kinematik jahrhunderte- 
lang allen Bedürfnissen genügte. 

3. Geometrische Darstellung der Einsteinschen Kinematik. 

Ehe wir den Inhalt dieser Formeln zu deuten suchen, wollen wir die 
durch sie dargestellten Beziehungen zwischen zwei Inertialsystemen nach 
der von Minkowski eingeführten Weise in der vierdimensionalen Welt xyzt 
geometrisch deuten. Dabei können wir die ungeändert bleibenden Ko- 
ordinaten^, z unbeachtet lassen und uns auf die Betrachtung der A:/-Ebene 
beschränken. Alle kinematischen Gesetze erscheinen dann als geometrische 
Tatsachen in der ^ /-Ebene. Dem Leser ist aber dringend zu empfehlen, 
die in geometrischer Form gewonnenen Beziehungen fortlaufend in die 
gewöhnliche Sprache der Kinematik zurück zu übersetzen. Er soll also 
unter einer Weltlinie wirklich die Bewegung eines Punktes verstehen, 
unter dem Schnitte zweier Weltlinien die Begegnung zweier bewegter 
Punkte usw. Man kann sich die Vorstellung der durch die Figuren dar- 
gestellten Vorgänge sehr erleichtern, indem man ein Lineal zur Hand 
nimmt, dieses parallel zur A:-Achse an der /-Achse entlang führt und die 
Schnittpunkte der Linealkante mit den Weltlinien ins Auge faßt; diese 
Punkte bewegen sich dann an der Kante hin und her und geben ein 
Bild des räumlichen Bewegungsablaufs. 

Jedes Inertialsystem S wird, wie wir gesehen haben (VI, i, S. 177), 
durch ein schiefwinkliges Achsenkreuz in der :v /-Ebene dargestellt; daß 
eines darunter rechtwinklig ist, muß als zufälliger Umstand betrachtet 
werden und spielt weiter keine Rolle. 

Jeder Raumpunkt kann Ausgangspunkt einer Lichtwelle sein, die sich 
als Kugel gleichförmig nach allen Seiten ausbreitet. Längs der hier allein 
betrachteten :x:-Richtung sind von dieser Kugelwelle nur zwei Lichtsignale 
vorhanden, von denen das eine nach links, das andere nach rechts läuft. 
Diese werden also in der :r/-Ebene durch zwei sich kreuzende Gerade 
dargestellt, die natürlich von der Wahl des Bezugsystems völlig unabhängig 
sind, da sie wirkliche Ereignisse, Weltpunkte, miteinander verknüpfen, 
nämlich die nacheinander von dem Lichtsignal getroffenen Raumstellen. 

Wir zeichnen diese Lichtlinien für einen Weltpunkt, der zugleich der 
Nullpunkt aller betrachteten rsc: /-Koordinatensysteme sein soll, und zwar als 
zwei aufeinander senkrechte Geraden; diese wählen wir als Achsen eines 
^/^-Koordinatensystems (Abb. 114). 



l82 



Das spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



Damit haben wir eines der Hauptmerkmale der Einsteinschen Theorie 
vor Augen: Das ^ly-System ist eindeutig bestimmt und in der »Welt« 
fest, obwohl seine Achsen nicht räumliche Gerade sind, sondern von den 
Weltpunkten gebildet werden, die ein vom Nullpunkt ausgehendes Licht- 
signal erreicht. Dieses invariante oder »absolute« Koordinatensystem ist 
also höchst abstrakter Art. Man muß sich daran gewöhnen, daß solche 
Abstraktionen in der modernen Theorie die konkrete Äthervorstellung 
ersetzen; ihre Stärke ist, daß sie nichts enthalten, was über die zur Deutung 

der Erfahrungen nötigen Begriffe 
hinausgeht. 

Mit diesem absoluten Bezug- 
systeme ^r^ müssen nun die £ü/i' 
kurven fest verbunden werden, die 
auf den Achsen eines beliebigen 
Inertialsystems xt die Einheiten der 
Länge und Zeit abschneiden. Diese 
Eichkurven müssen durch ein in- 
variantes Gesetz dargestellt sein, und 
es handelt sich darum, ein solches 
zu finden. 

Die Lichtlinien selbst sind in- 
variant. Die ^-Achse [iq = o) wird 
in einem Bezugsystem S durch die 
Formel x = et dargestellt, in einem andern Bezugsystem S' durch die 
Formel x = et' \ denn diese drücken aus, daß die Lichtgeschwindigkeit 
in beiden Systemen denselben Wert hat. Wir wollen nun die Differenz 
x' — et\ die für die Punkte der i^-Achse gleich Null ist, mit der Lorentz- 
Transformation (72) auf die Koordinaten x^ t umrechnen; dann folgt 



X — et' = — \[x — vt 
a 




Abb. 114. 






1+/^ 



« 



[x — et) 



et = o 



Hieraus sieht man, daß, wenn x — et = o ist, auch x 
wird. 

Für die ^y-Achse (^ = 0) ist ;c = — et und x = — et'\ machen wir 
die entsprechende Umrechnung von x' + et' in x^ /, so haben w ir oben 
nur e in — <;, also auch ß in — /? zu verwandeln (während a = Vi — ß"" 
unverändert bleibt) und erhalten: 

x' -\- et' = ^^" (x -\-et). 



Geometrische Darstellung der Einsteinschen Kinematik. 183 

Aus diesen beiden Formeln aber liest man leicht eine invariante Bil- 
dung ab; es ist nämlich {i -\- ß) {1 — ß) = i — ß^ == a'^ daher wird, 
wenn man die beiden Gleichungen miteinander multipliziert, der Faktor 
den Wert i bekommen und man findet 

{x' — et') [x + et') = {x — et) {x + et) 
oder 

:^'^- c't'' = x''—e''r: 

d. h. der Ausdruek 

(73) G = x'-e'e 

ist eine Invariante. Wegen ihres fundamentalen Charakters nennen wir sie 
die Grundinvariante. 

Sie dient uns zunächt zur Bestimmung der Längen- und Zeiteinheit 
in einem beliebigen Bezugsysteme S. 

Dazu fragen wir nach allen Weltpunkten, für die G den Wert + i 
oder — I hat. 

Offenbar ist G = 1 für den Weltpunkt x ■== 1^ / = o; das ist aber 
der Endpunkt eines vom Nullpunkte des Bezugsystems S aufgetragenen 
Einheitsmaßstabes im Augenblick / = o. Da das für alle Bezugsysteme S 
in gleicher Weise gilt, so erkennen wir, daß die Weltpunkte, für die G = i 
ist, die ruhende Längeneinheit für ein beliebiges Bezugsystem definieren, 
wie wir sogleich näher ausführen werden. 

Ebenso ist G = — i für den Weltpunkt x = o^ t = — ; dieser Welt- 
punkt hängt also in entsprechender Weise mit der Zeiteinheit der im 
System S ruhenden Uhr zusammen. 

Man kann nun die Punkte G = -\- i oder G == — i sehr leicht 
geometrisch konstruieren, indem man von dem invarianten Koordinaten- 
system §)] ausgeht. Die ^- Achse wird von den Punkten gebildet, für die 
rj = o ist; andererseits sind dieselben Weltpunkte in einem beliebigen 
Inertialsystem S dadurch gekennzeichnet, daß x = et ist. Daher muß 
7] mit X — et proportional sein; indem wir die Einheit von rj geeignet 
wählen, können wir 

j] = X — et 

setzen. Ganz ebenso findet man durch Betrachtung der r] -Achse, daß 
man 

§ = X -\- et 
setzen kann. Es ist dann 

^r] = {x — et) {x H- et) = x^ — e^'f = G. 

G = ^iq bedeutet offenbar den Inhalt eines Rechtecks mit den 
Seiten J und ry; will man einen Weltpunkt finden, für den G = §7] = i 
ist, so hat man nur darauf zu achten, daß das aus den Koordinaten 
5, Yj gebildete Rechteck den Flächeninhalt i hat. Alle diese Rechtecke 
lassen sich übersehen; unter ihnen ist das Quadrat mit der Seite i, 



i84 



Das spezielle Einstemsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



die übrigen sind um so höher, je schmäler sie sind, und um so nied- 
riger, je breiter sie sind, entsprechend der Bedingung r^ =^ (Abb. 115). 

Die Punkte f, rj bilden offenbar eine Kurve, die sich der §- und der rj- 
Achse immer mehr und mehr nähert ; man nennt diese Kurve eine gleich- 
seitige Hyperbel. Wenn ^ und v] beide negativ sind, so ist % - r\ positiv; 
daher liefert die Konstruktion einen zweiten, zum ersten spiegelbildlichen 
Hyperbelast im gegenüberliegenden Quadranten. 

Für G ■= — I gilt dieselbe Konstruktion in den beiden übrigen 
Quadranten, wo die Koordinaten J und iq verschiedenes Vorzeichen haben. 

Die vier Hyperbeln bilden nun die gesuchten Eichkurven., durch die 
die Einheiten für Längen und Zeiten für alle Bezugsysteme xt festgelegt 
werden. 

Die :*;-Achse treffe die Hyperbeläste (9 = + i in den Punkten P und 
/^; die /-Achse die Hyperbeläste 6^ = — i in Q und Q (Abb. 116). 





Abb. 115. 



Abb. 116. 



Wir ziehen durch P eine Parallele zur /-Achse und behaupten, daß 
diese den rechten Eichkurvenast 6^ = -f- i nicht noch in einem zweiten 
Punkte schneidet, sondern gerade in P berührt. Mit andern Worten, 
wir sagen, daß kein einziger Punkt dieses Eichkurvenastes links von 
der Geraden liegt, sondern daß der ganze Ast rechts von ihr verläuft, 
alle seine Punkte also jc- Koordinaten haben, die größer sind als die 
Strecke OP. 

Das ist in der Tat der Fall. Denn für jeden Punkt der Eichkurve 
G =^ x"^ — c'^f = \ ist a;^ = I + c^f\ also ist für den Punkt P der 
Eichkurve, der zugleich auf der :^-Achse /= o liegt, :v^ = i, für jeden 
andern Eichkurvenpunkt aber ist x"^ um den positiven Betrag c'^f größer 
als I. Mithin ist 0P= i und für jeden Punkt des rechten Eichkurven- 
astes ist X größer als i. 

Ganz ebenso folgt, daß die durch P' gezogene Parallele zur /-Achse 
den linken Hyperbelast 6^ = i m P' berührt, und daß die durch Q 



Geometrische Darstellung der Einsteinschen Kinematik. 185 



und Q' zur A:-Achse gezogenen Parallelen die Hyperbeläste G = — i 

in Q und Q' berühren. Dabei wird offenbar die Strecke 0Q = — ; 

denn der Punkt Q liegt auf der Eichkurve G = x^ — c^^t"^ ^= — i und 

auf der ^-Achse ^ = o, also ist für ihn c^t^ = 1 / = — . 

' c 

Die beiden Parallelen zur /-Achse durch F und P' treffen die Licht- 
linien ^, rj in den Punkten R und R' \ durch dieselben Punkte gehen 
aber auch die Parallelen zur :i--Achse durch Q und Q' . Denn es gilt 
z. B. für den Punkt R x = ci^ weil er auf der ^- Achse liegt, und 
X = \^ weil er auf der Parallelen zur /-Achse durch P liegt; daraus 

folgt / = — , d. h. er liegt auf der Parallelen zur ::c-Achse durch Q, 

Nun sieht man, daß diese Konstruktion der A:-Achse mit der vorher 
(S- 177) gegebenen der gleichzeitigen Weltpunkte übereinstimmt. Denn 
die /-Achse O Q und die beiden Parallelen PR und P' R' sind die Welt- 
linien dreier Punkte, deren einer O in der Mitte der beiden andern P^ P' 
liegt; läßt man nun von O ein Lichtsignal nach beiden Seiten laufen, so 
wird dieses durch die Lichtlinien ^^ rj dargestellt, es trifft also die beiden 
äußeren Weltlinien in R und R'. Folglich sind diese beiden Weltpunkte 
gleichzeitig, ihre Verbindungslinie der ^r-Achse parallel, genau, wie es 
unsere neue Konstruktion ergeben hat. 

Wir fassen nun das Resultat dieser Überlegung kurz zusammen: 

Du Achsen x und t eines Beziigsystems S liegen so zueinander ^ daß 
jede von ihnen derjenigen Geraden parallel ist^ die die Eichkurve im Durch- 
Stoßungspunkte mit der andern Achse berührt. 

Die Längeneinheit wird durch die Strecke OP dargestellt; die Zeit- 
einheit wird durch die Strecke OQ bestimmt, die allerdings nicht i sec, 

sondern — sec bedeutet. 
c 

Jede Weltlinie, die die Eichkurvenäste G = i trifft, kann als A:-Achse 
genommen werden; dann ist die /-Achse als Parallele zu der in P be- 
rührenden Geraden festgelegt. Ebenso kann auch die /-Achse als eine 
beliebige, die Eichkurvenäste (9 = — i treffende Weltlinie gewählt wer- 
den; die zugehörige ;\f-Achse ist durch die analoge Konstruktion ein- 
deutig bestimmt. 

Diese Regeln treten an die Stelle der Sätze der klassischen Kinematik; 
dort war die :r-Achse für alle Inertialsysteme dieselbe, die Längeneinheit 
auf ihr fest gegeben und die Zeiteinheit gleich dem Abschnitte auf der 
im allgemeinen schiefen /-Achse, den eine bestimmte, zur :\:-Achse paral- 
lele Gerade auf ihr abschneidet (s. S. 60, Abb. 41). 

Wie kommt es nun, daß diese anscheinend so verschiedenen Kon- 
struktionen tatsächlich kaum unterscheidbar sind? 

Das liegt an dem ungeheuer großen Werte der Lichtgeschwindigkeit ^, 
wenn man diesen in cm und sec mißt. Will man nämlich in der Figur i sec 



i86 



Das spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



und I cm durch Strecken derselben Länge darstellen, so muß man offenbar 
die Zeichnung in der /-Richtung zusammendrücken, so daß sich alle der 
/-Achse parallelen Strecken im Verhältnisse i : c zusammendrängen. Wäre 
<;= IG, so würde sich ein Bild ergeben, wie es die Abb. 117 dar- 
stellt; die beiden Lichtlinien würden einen ganz spitzen Winkel bilden, 
der den Spielraum der :<;-Achsen darstellt, dafür würde der Winkelraum 

der /-Achsen sehr groß; 
je größer c ist, um so 
mehr würde die quanti- 
tative Verschiedenheit der 
Veränderlichkeit der x- 
und /-Richtung hervor- 
treten. Für den wirk- 
lichen Wert von ^, näm- 
lich c ■= 3 • io^° cm/sec, 
könnte man die Zeich- 
nung auf dem Papier über- 
haupt nicht mehr aus- 
führen; die beiden Lichtlinien würden praktisch zusammenfallen, die x- 
Richtung, die immer zwischen ihnen liegt, also konstant sein. Das ist 
gerade die Annahme der gewöhnlichen Kinematik; man sieht also, daß 
diese ein Spezialfall oder besser ein Grenzfall der Einsteinschen Kine- 
matik ist, nämlich der Grenzfall unendlich großer Lichtgeschwindigkeit. 




Abb. 117. 



4. Bewegte Maßstäbe und Uhren. 

Wir wollen jetzt die einfachsten kinematischen Fragen beantworten, 
die die Beurteilung der Länge ein und desselben Maßstabes und ein und 
derselben Zeitdauer von verschiedenen ßezugsystemen aus betreffen. 

Ein Stab von der Länge i werde vom Nullpunkt des Systems S aus 
längs der :*:- Achse hingelegt; wir fragen nach seiner Länge im System *S'. 
Daß diese nicht ebenfalls gleich i sein wird, ist ohne weiteres klar; denn 
die mit S mitbewegten Beobachter werden natürlich die Lagen der End- 
punkte des Stabes gleichzeitig messen, d. h. gleichzeitig im Bezugsystem S' . 
Das ist aber nicht gleichzeitig im Bezugsystem S\ wenn also auch die 
Lage des einen Stabendes in S und S' gleichzeitig abgelesen wird, so 
wird die des andern Stabendes bezüglich der »S-Zeit von den Beobachtern 
der Systeme S und S' nicht gleichzeitig abgelesen; in der Zwischenzeit 
hat aber das System S sich fortbewegt, die Ablesung der »S'-Leute betrifft 
also eine verschobene Lage des zweiten Stabendes. 

Diese Sache erscheint auf den ersten Blick hoffnungslos verwickelt. 
Es gibt Gegner des Relativitätsprinzips, simple Geister, die nach Anhören 
dieser Schv/ierigkeit, eine Stablänge festzustellen, empört ausrufen: »Ja, i 
mit gefälschten Uhren kann man natürlich alles ableiten; hier sieht man, 
zu welchen Absurditäten der blinde Glaube an die Zauberkraft mathe- 



Bewegte Maßstäbe und Uhren. 



187 



matischer Formeln führt«, worauf sie die Relativitätstheorie in Bausch 
und Bogen verdammen. Die Leser unserer Darstellung werden hoffentlich 
begriffen haben, daß die Formeln keineswegs das Wesentliche sind, son- 
dern daß es sich um rein begriffliche Zusammenhänge handelt, die man 
auch ohne Mathematik recht gut verstehen kann; ja, man könnte im 
Grunde nicht nur auf die Formeln, sondern sogar auf die geometrischen 
Figuren verzichten und alles in den Worten der gewöhnlichen Sprache 
vortragen, nur würde das Buch dann so weitschweifig und unübersichtlich 
werden, daß kein Verleger es drucken, kein Leser es studieren würde. 

Wir benutzen nun zunächst 
unsere Figur in der ^ /-Ebene, 
um die Frage nach der Längen- 
bestimmung des Stabes in den 
beiden Systemen S und S' zu 
lösen (Abb. 118). 

Der Stab soll im System 
6" (xy t) ruhen; daher ist die 
Weltlinie seines Anfangspunktes 
die /-Achse, die seines End- 
punktes die dazu parallele Ge- 
rade im Abstände i ; diese be- 
rührt die Eichkurve im Punkte 
P. Der ganze Stab wird also 
für alle Zeiten durch den Streifen 
zwischen diesen beiden Geraden 
dargestellt. 

Nun soll seine Länge im Systeme 6" [x\ t') bestimmt werden, welches 
gegen S bewegt ist; seine /'-Achse ist also gegen die /-Achse geneigt. 
Wir finden die zugehörige :x;'-Achse, indem wir im Durchstoßungspunkte 
Q der /-Achse mit der Eichkurve die Tansjente und zu dieser durch O 
die Parallele OP' ziehen. Die Strecke OP" ist die Längeneinheit auf 
der :t:'-Achse. Die Länge des im System S ruhenden Einheitsstabes ge- 
messen im System *S' aber wird bestimmt durch die Strecke OR' ^ die 
der den Stab darstellende Parallelstreifen aus der :x:'-Achse ausschneidet; 
diese ist offenbar kürzer als O P' ^ also ist O R' kleiner als i: Der Stab 
erscheint im bewegten Systeme S' verkürzt. 

Das ist genau die von Fitz-Gerald und Lorentz zur Erklärung des 
Michelsonschen Versuches ersonnene Kontraktion, die hier als natürliche 
Folge der Einsteinschen Kinematik erscheint. 

Wenn umgekehrt ein im System S' ruhender Maßstab vom System S 
aus gemessen wird, erscheint er natürlich ebenfalls verkürzt, nicht etwa 
verlängert; denn ein solcher Stab wird durch den Streifen dargestellt, der 
durch die /-Achse und die zu ihr parallele Weltlinie durch den Punkt P' 
begrenzt ist, die letztere trifft aber die Einheitsstrecke O P des Systems 5 
in einem innern Punkte i?, so daß OR kleiner als i ist. 




Abb. 118. 



i88 



Das spezielle Emsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



Die Kontraktion ist also durchaus wechselseitig, wie es das Relativitäts- 
prinzip verlangt. 

Die Größe der Kontraktion finden wir am besten mit Hilfe der 
Lorentztransformation (72). 

4 sei die Länge des Stabes in dem Bezugsystem 5', in dem er ruht; 
man nennt 4 auch Ruhlänge oder Eigenlänge des Stabes. 

Soll nun die Länge des Stabes, wie sie vom System »S aus beurteilt 
wird, festgestellt werden, so hat man / = o zu setzen, was die Gleichzeitigkeit 
der Ablesung der Lage beider Stabenden bezüglich S ausdrückt. Dann 
folgt aus der ersten Gleichung der Lorentztransformation (72) 

X 



X 



v~ 



Nun ist für den Anfangspunkt des Stabes x = o, also auch x' = o ; 
für seinen Endpunkt ist x' = /^^ und wenn x =^ l die Stablänge, ge- 
messen im System »S, bedeutet, so erhält man 

(74) • /=4Ki-p- 

Dies besagt, daß die Stab- 
länge im System S im Ver- 
hältnisse Vi — ß^:i ver- 
kürzt erscheint, genau in 
Übereinstimmung mit der 
Kontraktionshypothese von 
Fitz-Gerald und Lorentz (V, 
15, S. 168). 

Dieselben Überlegungen 
gelten für die Bestimmung 
einer Zeitdauer in zwei ver- 
schiedenen Systemen S 
und S'. 

Wir denken uns in allen 
Raumpunkten des Systems S 
•119- gleichgehende Uhren ange- 

bracht. Diese haben gleichzeitig bezüglich S eine bestimmte Zeigerstel- 
lung; die Stellung t = o wird durch die Weltpunkte der ^-Achse, die 

Stellung t = — durch die Weltpunkte der zur ^-Achse parallelen, durch 
c 

den Punkt Q gehenden Geraden dargestellt (Abb. 119). 

Im Nullpunkt des Systems S' sei eine Uhr angebracht, die für / = o 
auch /' = o zeigt; fragen wir nun, welche Stellung der Zeiger einer Uhr 
des Systems S hat, die sich an der Stelle befindet, wo die in S' ruhende 

Uhr gerade die Zeit / = — anzeigt. Der gesuchte Wert von t wird ofifen- 




Schein und Wirklichkeit. 189 



bar durch den Schnittpunkt Q' der /'-Achse mit der Eichkurve G = — i 

bestimmt; dagegen wird die Zeigerstellung / = — der in S ruhenden 

Uhren durch die Punkte der Geraden dargestellt, die durch Q zur jjc-Achse 
parallel gelegt ist. Diese Gerade trifft die /'-Achse in einem Punkte R' ^ 
und die Figur zeigt, das Q^ außerhalb der Strecke QR' liegt; das bedeutet 
aber, die Zeiteinheit des System-S S' erscheint im System S verlängert. 

Um den Betrag der Verlängerung festzustellen, setzen wir in der Lorentz- 
Transformation für die im Nullpunkt von S' befindliche Uhr x = o, also 
X = v^\ dann wird

Ein Zeitintervall f^ im System S\ /' = 4 > wird demnach im System S als

V 

gemessen, erscheint also verlängert. Die Zeitdilatation ist zur Längen- 
kontraktion reziprok. 

Natürlich erscheint auch umgekehrt die Zeiteinheit einer im Systeme S 
ruhenden Uhr im Systeme S' vergrößert. 

Man kann auch sagen, daß von irgend einem System aus beurteilt, 
die Uhren jedes dagegen bewegten Systems nachzugehen scheinen. Die 
zeitlichen Abläufe in dem relativ bewegten System sind langsamer, alle 
Vorgänge in diesem System bleiben hinter den entsprechenden des als 
ruhend betrachteten Systems zurück. Wir kommen nachher auf die hieraus 
entspringenden, häufig als paradox bezeichneten Umstände zurück. 

Man nennt die Zeitangabe einer Uhr in dem Bezugsystem, in dem 
sie ruht, die Eigenzeit des Systems. Diese ist identisch mit der »Ortszeit« 
von Lorentz; der Fortschritt der Einsteinschen Theorie "betrifft nicht die 
formalen Gesetze, als vielmehr ihre prinzipielle Auffassung. Bei Lorentz 
erschien die Ortszeit als mathematische Hilfsgröße im Gegensatz zu der 
wahren, absoluten Zeit. Einstein stellte fest, daß es kein Mittel gibt, 
diese absolute Zeit zu bestimmen, sie aus den unendlich vielen, gleich- 
berechtigten Ortszeiten der verschieden bewegten Bezugsysteme heraus- 
zufinden. Das bedeutet aber, daß die absolute Zeit keine physikalische 
Realität hat; Zeitangaben haben nur Sinn relativ zu bestimmten Bezug- 
systemen. Damit ist die Relativierung des Zeitbegriffes durchgeführt. 

5. Schein und Wirklichkeit. 

Nachdem wir die Gesetze der Einsteinschen Kinematik in der doppelten 
Gestalt von Figuren und Formeln kennen gelernt haben, müssen wir sie 
vom Standpunkte der Erkenntnistheorie kurz beleuchten. 



I Qo Das spezielle Einstemsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

Man könnte nämlich zu der Meinung gelangen, daß es sich in der 
Einsteinschen Theorie gar nicht um neue Erkenntnisse über die Dinge 
der physikalischen Welt handle, sondern nur um Definitionen konven- 
tioneller Art, die zwar den Forderungen der Empirie angepaßt sind, aber 
ebensogut durch andere Bestimmungen ersetzt werden könnten. Dieser 
Gedanke liegt nahe, wenn wir an den Ausgangspunkt unserer Betrachtungen, 
das Beispiel des Schleppzuges, denken, wobei das Konventionelle, Will- 
kürliche der Einsteinschen Definition der Gleichzeitigkeit ins Auge springt. 
Tatsächlich ließe sich die ganze Einsteinsche Kinematik für Schiffe, die 
sich durch windstille Luft bewegen, vollkommen durchführen, wenn man 
Schallsignale zur Uhrregulieiung benützt; die Größe c würde dann in allen 
Formeln die Schallgeschwindigkeit bedeuten. Jedes fahrende Schiflf würde 
je nach seiner Geschwindigkeit seine eigenen Einheiten für Längen und 
Zeiten haben und zwischen den Maßsystemen verschiedener Schiffe würden 
die Lorentz-Transformationen gelten; man hätte eine widerspruchslose Ein- 
steinsche Welt im > Kleinen«. 

Aber diese Widerspruchslosigkeit besteht nur so lange, als wir zulassen, 
daß die Einheiten für Längen und Zeiten durch keine andere Forderung 
eingeschränkt sein sollen, als daß die beiden Prinzipien der Relativität 
und der Konstanz der Schall- bzw. Lichtgeschwindigkeit gelten. Ist das 
die Meinung der Einsteinschen Theorie? 

Sicherlich nicht. Vielmehr wird selbstverständlich vorausgesetzt, daß ein 
Stab, der in zwei Bezugsystemen S und S' relativ zu diesen unter genau die- 
selben physikalischen Bedingungen gebracht, etwa der Einwirkung aller Kräfte 
möglichst entzogen wird, beidemal dieselbe Länge vorstellt. Ein ruhender, 
fester Maßstab im System S von der Länge i soll natürlich auch im System 
S' die Länge i haben, wenn er dort ruht und wenn Vorsorge getroffen ist, 
daß die übrigen physikalischen Verhältnisse (Schwerkraft, Lagerung, Tem- 
peratur, elektrische und magnetische Felder usw.) in S' möglichst dieselben 
sind wie in S. Genau das entsprechende wird man für die Uhren verlangen. 

Man könnte diese stillschweigend gemachte Voraussetzung der Einstein- 
schen Theorie das »Prinzip von der physikalischen Identität der Maß- 
einheiten« nennen. 

Sobald man sich dieses Prinzips bewußt ist, sieht man, daß mit ihm 
die Übertragung der Einsteinschen Kinematik auf den Fall der Schiffe 
und der Uhrenvergleichung mit Schallsignalen im Widerspruche steht. 
Denn die nach Einsteins Vorschrift mit Hilfe der Schallgeschwindigkeit 
bestimmten Längen- und Zeiteinheiten werden natürlich keineswegs gleich 
den mit festen Maßstäben und gewöhnlichen Uhren gemessenen Längen- 
und Zeiteinheiten sein; die ersten sind nicht nur auf jedem fahrenden 
Schiffe andere, je nach dessen Geschwindigkeit, sondern es ist außerdem 
die Längeneinheit querschiffs von der längsschiffs verschieden. Die Ein- 
steinsche Kinematik wäre also zwar eine mögliche Definition, aber in 
diesem Falle nicht einmal eine nützliche; die gewöhnlichen Maßstäbe und 
Uhren wären ihr zweifellos überlegen. 



Schein und Wirklichkeit. igj 



Aus demselben Grunde ist es auch nur schwer möglich, die Einsteinsche 
Kinematik durch Modelle zu veranschaulichen. Diese geben wohl die- 
Beziehungen zwischen Längen und Zeiten in verschiedenen Systemen 
richtig wieder, stehen aber mit dem Prinzip der Identität der Maßein- 
heiten im Widerspruche; die Längenskala muß eben in zwei relativ zu- 
einander bewegten Systemen S und S' des Modells verschieden ge- 
wählt werden. 

Ganz anders soll es nun nach Einstein in der wirklichen Welt sein; dort 
soll die neue Kinematik gerade gelten, wenn man denselben Stab, dieselbe 
Uhr erst im System 6", dann im System S' zur Festlegung der Längen 
und Zeiten benutzt. Damit aber erhebt sich die Einsteinsche Theorie über 
den Standpunkt einer bloßen Konvention zur Behauptung bestimmter 
Eigenschaften der wirklichen Körper; dadurch erst gewinnt sie die funda- 
mentale Bedeutung für die ganze Naturauffassung. 

Sehr klar tritt dieser wichtige Umstand hervor, wenn man die Römersche 
Methode zur Messung der Lichtgeschwindigkeit mit Hilfe der Jupitermonde 
ins Auge faßt. Das ganze Sonnensystem bewegt sich relativ zu den Fix- 
sternen; denken wir uns mit diesen ein Bezugsystem S fest verbunden, 
so definiert die Sonne mit ihren Planeten ein anderes System S' . Der 
Jupiter mit seinen Satelliten ist eine (ideal gute) Uhr mit ihren Zeigern; 
diese wird im Kreise herumbewegt, so daß sie bald in die Richtung der 
relativen Bewegung von S' gegen S^ bald in die entgegengesetzte gelangt. 
Man kann den Gang der Jupiter-Uhr in diesen Stellungen keineswegs 
durch Konvention willkürlich bestimmen, derart daß die Zeit, die das 
Licht zum Durchlaufen des Durchmessers der Erdbahn braucht, in allen 
Richtungen gleich ist; sondern das ist ganz von selbst so, dank der Ein- 
richtung der Jupiter-Uhr. Diese zeigt eben die Eigenzeit des Sonnen- 
systems S' an, nicht irgendeint absolute Zeit oder die fremde Zeit des 
Fixsternsystems S\ mit andern Worten, die Umlaufszeit der Jupitermonde 
ist relativ zum Sonnensystem konstant (wobei von der Geschwindigkeit 
des Jupiter selbst relativ zum Sonnensystem abgesehen wird). 

Nun behaupten manche, daß diese Anschauung einen Verstoß gegen 
das Kausalgesetz bedeute. Wenn nämlich ein und derselbe Maßstab vom 
System S aus beurteilt eine verschiedene Länge hat, je nachdem er in 
5 ruht oder sich relativ zu S bewegt, so muß, sagen diese, eine Ursache 
für diese Veränderung vorhanden sein. Aber die Einsteinsche Theorie 
gibt keine Ursache an, behauptet vielmehr, daß die Kontraktion von 
selbst, als Begleitumstand der Tatsache der Bewegung, einträte. Dieser 
Einwand ist aber nicht berechtigt; er beruht auf einer zu engen Fassung 
des Begriffes »Veränderung«. An sich hat ja solch ein Begriff gar keinen 
Sinn, er bedeutet nichts Absolutes, ebensowenig wie Größen- oder Zeit- 
angaben absolute Bedeutung haben. Man ist doch nicht geneigt, zu sagen, 
ein gegen ein Inertialsystem S gleichförmig und geradlinig bewegter Körper 
»erleidet eine Veränderung«, obwohl er doch seinen 6^r/ gegen das System 
5 verändert. Welche »Veränderungen« die Physik als Wirkungen zählt,

Das spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



für die Ursachen zu suchen sind, ist durchaus nicht a priori klar, sondern 
wird erst durch die empirische Forschung selbst bestimmt. 

Die Auffassung der Einsteinschen Theorie über das Wesen der Kon- 
traktion ist diese: 

Ein materieller Stab ist physikalisch nicht ein räumliches Ding, sondern 
durchaus ein raum-zeitliches Gebilde; jeder Punkt des Stabes ist jetzt, 
und jetzt, und jetzt immer noch, zu jeder Zeit. Das adäquate Bild des 
(räumlich eindimensional) gedachten Stabes ist also nicht eine Strecke der 
A:-Achse, sondern ein Streifen der ::c/-Ebene (Abb. 120). Derselbe Stab, 
in verschieden bewegten Systemen S und S' ruhend, wird durch ver- 
schiedene Streifen dargestellt. Es gibt a priori ^eme Regel, wie diese 
2-dimensionalen Gebilde der ^ /-Ebene zu zeichnen sind, damit sie das 
physikalische Verhalten ein und desselben Stabes bei verschiedenen Ge- 
schwindigkeiten richtig darstellen. Dazu muß erst eine Eichkurve in der 
:;<: /-Ebene festgelegt werden. Die klassische Kinematik zeichnet diese 
anders wie die Einsteinsche; welche recht hat, ist a priori nicht fest- 
zustellen. In der klassischen Theorie haben die beiden Streifen dieselbe 

Breite gemessen parallel zu einer 
festen :x:-Achse; in der Einsteinschen 
Theorie haben sie dieselbe Breite 
gemessen in den verschiedenen x- 
Richtungen der relativ bewegten 
Bezugsysteme mit verschiedenen, 
aber bestimmten Einheiten. Die 
»Kontraktion« betrifft gar nicht den 
Streifen, sondern die von einer x- 
Achse ausgeschnittene Strecke; aber 
nur der Streifen als Mannigfaltigkeit 
von Weltpunkten, Ereignissen, hat 
physikalische Realität, nicht der 
Querschnitt. Die Kontraktion ist also nur eine Folge der Betrachtungs- 
weise, keine Veränderung einer physikalischen Realität; also fällt sie nicht 
unter die Begriffe von Ursache und Wirkung. 

Durch diese Auffassung wird auch jene berüchtigte Streitfrage er- 
ledigt, ob die Kontraktion »wirklich« oder nur »scheinbar« ist. Wenn 
ich mir von einer Wurst eine Scheibe abschneide, so wird diese größer 
oder kleiner, je nachdem ich mehr oder weniger schief schneide. Es ist 
sinnlos, die verschiedenen Größen der Wurstscheiben als »scheinbar« zu 
bezeichnen und etwa die kleinste, die bei senkrechtem Schnitt entsteht, 
als die »wirkliche« Größe. 

Genau so hat ein Stab in der Einsteinschen Theorie verschiedene 
Längen, je nach dem Standpunkte des Beobachters; von diesen ist eine 
die größte, die Ruhlänge, aber darum ist sie nicht wirklicher als die 
andern. Die Anwendung der Disjunktion von »scheinbar« und »wirklich«] 
in diesem naiven Sinne ist nicht klüger, als wenn man fragt, welches di<

wirkliche ^-Koordinate eines Punktes xy sei, ohne daß man angibt, 
welches ^^-Koordinatensystem gemeint sei. 

Ganz entsprechendes gilt von der Relativität der Zeit. Eine ideale 
Uhr hat in dem Bezugsystem, in dem sie ruht, immer ein und denselben 
Gang; sie zeigt die »Eigenzeit« des Bezugsystems an. Von einem andern 
System aus beurteilt aber geht sie langsamer; ein bestimmter Abschnitt 
der Eigenzeit erscheint dort als länger. Auch hier ist wieder die Frage 
sinnlos, welches die »wirkliche« Dauer eines Vorganges sei. 

Bei richtiger Auffassung enthält die Einsteinsche Kinematik keinerlei 
Dunkelheiten oder gar innere Widersprüche. Wohl aber stehen viele 
ihrer Ergebnisse im Gegensatz zu gewohnten Denkformen oder zu Lehren 
der klassischen Physik. Wo diese Gegensätze besonders kraß sind, werden 
sie häufig als unerträglich, als paradox empfunden. Wir werden im fol- 
genden zahlreiche Schlüsse aus der Einsteinschen Theorie ziehen, die 
zuerst starken Widerspruch fanden, bis es gelang, sie experimentell zu 
bestätigen. Hier aber wollen wir eine Überlegung mitteilen, die zu be- 
sonders merkwürdigen Ergebnissen führt, ohne daß es möglich erscheint, 
diese durch das Experiment zu prüfen; es handelt sich um das sogenannte 
»Uhren- Paradoxon «. 

Man denke sich einen Beobachter A im Nullpunkt O des Inertial- 
systems S ruhend; ein zweiter Beobachter B soll sich zunächst am selben 
Orte O in Ruhe befinden, dann mit gleichförmiger Geschwindigkeit auf 
gerader Linie, etwa der :!c-Achse, forteilen, bis er einen Punkt C erreicht 
dort soll er umkehren und wieder mit derselben Geschwindigkeit gerad- 
linig nach O zurückkehren. 

Beide Beobachter haben ideale Uhren bei sich, die ihre Eigenzeit 
anzeigen. Die Zeitabschnitte der Beschleunigung bei der Abreise, der 
Umkehr und der Ankunft von B kann man im Verhältnis zu der Dauer 
der ganzen Reise so kurz machen wie man will, indem man die Zeit- 
dauer der gleichförmigen Bewegungen hin und zurück hinreichend groß 
macht; wenn etwa der Gang der Uhren durch die Beschleunigung beein- 
flußt werden sollte, so wird diese Wirkung bei genügend langer Reise- 
dauer verhältnismäßig beliebig klein bleiben, so daß man sie vernach- 
lässigen kann. Dann muß aber die Uhr des Beobachters B nach seiner 
Rückkehr nach O gegen die Uhr von A nachgehen; denn wir wissen 
(VI, 4, S. 189), daß während der Perioden gleichförmiger Bewegung von 
Bj die für das Resultat maßgebend sind, die Eigenzeit hinter der Zeit 
irgend eines andern Inertialsystems zurückbleibt. Man sieht dies beson- 
ders anschaulich an dem geometrischen Bilde in der jc/- Ebene (Abb. 121). 
In diesem haben wir der Bequemlichkeit halber die Achsen des A:/-Systems 
aufeinander senkrecht gezeichnet. Die Weltlinie des Punktes A ist die 
/-Achse; die Weltlinie des Punktes B ist die geknickte (punktiert ge- 
zeichnete) Linie OUR^ deren Knickpunkt 6^ auf der zur /-Achse parallelen 
Weltlinie des Umkehrpunktes C liegt. 

Durch U legen wir die aus der Eichkurve (9 = — i durch ent- 
Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. I^

sprechende Vergrößerung hervorgehende Hyperbel; diese treffe die /-Achse 
in Q. Dann ist offenbar die Eigenzeitstrecke O Q für den Beobachter A 
genau gleich der Eigenzeitstrecke O U für den Beobachter B. Die Eigen- 
zeitdauer für A bis zum Rückkehrpunkte R ist aber, wie die Figur lehrt, 
mehr als doppelt so groß wie OQ^ während sie für ^ genau doppelt so 
groß ist wie OU. Daher hat die Uhr von A im Augenblicke der Rück- 
kehr einen Vorsprung vor der Uhr von B. 

Die Größe des Vorsprungs berechnet sich leicht aus der Formel (75), 
worin t^ die Eigenzeit von A^ t die Zeit gemessen im System B be- 
deutet. Beschränken wir uns auf kleine Geschwindigkeiten von B und 

sehen ß =- als kleine Zahl an, so können wir statt (75) näherungsweise 
c 

(s. Anmerkung auf S. 164) schreiben: 




^ = ^o(i-+-fr); 

daher ist der Vorsprung der 
Uhr von A über die von B

und das gilt in jedem Augen- 
blick der Bewegung, da Hin- 
und Rückreise mit derselben 
Geschwindigkeit erfolgen; es 
gilt also insbesondere auch für 
den Augenblick der Rückkehr, 
wobei dann t^ die gesamte 
Reisedauer nach der Eigenzeit 
von A^ t die Reisedauer nach 
der Eigenzeit von B bedeutet. 
Dc\s Paradoxe dieses Ergebnisses liegt darin, daß jeder innere Vor- 
gang im System B langsamer ablaufen muß als derselbe Vorgang im 
System A. Alle Atomschwingungen, ja der Lebenslauf selbst müssen sich 
gerade so verhalten wie die Uhren ; wenn also A und B Zwillingsbrüder 
sind, so muß B nach der Rückkehr von der Reise jünger sein als der 
Bruder A. In der Tat, ein wunderlicher Schluß, der aber durch keine 
Deutelei zu beseitigen ist. Man muß sich damit abfinden, wie man sich 
vor einigen Jahrhunderten mit den auf dem Kopfe stehenden Antipoden 
abfinden mußte; da es sich, wie die Formel (76) zeigt, um einen Effekt 
zweiter Ordnung handelt, werden sich schwerlich praktische Konsequenzen 
daraus ergeben. 

Wenn man sich gegen dieses Ergebnis zur Wehr setzt und es als 
paradox bezeichnet, so meint man mit diesem Worte nichts als > unge- 
wohnt«, »sonderbar«; darüber hilft die Zeit hinweg. Aber es gibt auch 
Gegner der Relativitcätstheorie, die aus dieser Überlegung einen Ein- 



Schein und Wirklichkeit. ig^ 



wand gegen die logische Folgerichtigkeit der Theorie ableiten wollen. 
Diese argumentieren so: Nach der Relativitätstheorie sind zwei gegen- 
einander bewegte Systeme gleichberechtigt. Man kann also auch B als 
ruhend auffassen; dann vollführt A eine Reise in genau derselben Weise 
wie vorher B^ nur in der entgegengesetzten Richtung. Man muß daher 
schließen, daß die Uhr von B bei der Rückkehr von A einen Vorsprung 
vor der Uhr von A hat. Aber vorher waren wir genau zu dem entgegen- 
gesetzten Ergebnis gekommen. Da nun nicht die Uhr von A vor der 
Uhr von B vorgehen und zugleich die Uhr von B vor der Uhr von A 
vorgehen kann, so enthüllt diese Überlegung einen inneren Widerspruch 
der Theorie — so meinen die Oberflächlichen. Der Fehler dieser Über- 
legung liegt auf der Hand; das Relativitätsprinzip betrifft nur gleich- 
förmig und geradlinig gegeneinander bewegte Systeme ; auf beschleunigte 
Systeme ist es in der bisher allein entwickelten Form nicht anwendbar. 
Aber das System B ist beschleunigt; es ist also nicht mit A gleich- 
wertig. A ist ein Inertialsystem, B ist es nicht. Später werden wir 
allerdings sehen, daß die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins auch 
gegeneinander beschleunigte Systeme als gleichwertig betrachtet, doch in 
einem Sinne, der genauer Erörterung bedarf; wir werden von diesem 
aligemeinen Standpunkte noch einmal auf das »Uhrenparadoxon« zurück- 
kommen und zeigen, daß auch da bei sorgfältiger Überlegung keinerlei 
Schwierigkeiten vorliegen. Wir haben nämlich oben die Annahme ge- 
macht, daß bei hinreichend langer Reisedauer die kurzen Beschleunigungs- 
zeiten auf den Gang der Uhren keinen Einfluß haben; aber das gilt nur 
für die Betrachtung von dem Inertialsystem A aus, nicht für die Zeit- 
messung in dem beschleunigten System B. In diesem treten nach den 
Prinzipien der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie Gravitationsfelder auf, die 
den Gang der Uhren beeinflussen; wenn diese Wirkung berücksichtigt 
wird, so ergibt sich, daß unter allen Umständen die Uhr von B gegen- 
über der von A vorgeht, und damit verschwindet der scheinbare Wider- 
spruch (s. VII, 10, S. 257). 

Die Relativierung der Begriff"e von Länge und Zeitdauer erscheint 
vielen schwierig; doch wohl nur darum, weil sie ungewohnt ist. Die 
Relativierung der Begriff'e »unten« und >oben« durch die Entdeckung der 
Kugelgestalt der Erde hat den Zeitgenossen sicherlich nicht geringere 
Schwierigkeiten bereitet. Auch hier widersprach das Ergebnis der 
Forschung einer aus dem unmittelbaren Erlebnis geschöpften Anschauung. 
Ähnlich scheint Einsteins Relativierung der Zeit mit dem Zeiterlebnisse 
des einzelnen nicht in Übereinstimmung zu sein; denn das Gefühl des 
»Jetzt« erstreckt sich schrankenlos über die Welt, alles Sein eindeutig 
mit dem Ich verknüpfend. Daß dasselbe, was das Ich als »zugleich« 
empfindet, ein anderer als »nacheinander« bezeichnen soll, das läßt 
sich in der Tat durch das Zeiterlebnis nicht begreifen. Aber die exakte 
Wissenschaft hat andere Kriterien der Wahrheit; da das absolute »Zugleich* 
nicht feststellbar ist, muß sie diesen Begriff aus ihrem System ausmerzen.

6. Die Addition der Geschwindigkeiten. 

Wir wollen jetzt tiefer in die Gesetze der Einsteinschen Kinematik 
eindringen. Dabei beschränken wir uns zumeist auf die Betrachtung der 
a:/- Ebene; die Verallgemeinerung der gewonnenen Sätze auf den vier- 
dimensionalen xyz t-Raum bringt keine wesentlichen Schwierigkeiten mit 
sich und soll darum nur gelegentlich gestreift werden. 

Die Lichtlinien, die durch G = x^ — c^t^ = o gekennzeichnet sind, 
teilen die :r/-Ebene in vier Quadranten (Abb. 122); in jedem Quadranten 
behält offenbar G dasselbe Vorzeichen, und zwar ist (?^o in den beiden 
gegenüberliegenden Quadranten, die die Hyperbeläste G = -\- i enthalten, 
und es ist G <C, o in den beiden gegenüberliegenden Quadranten, die 
die Hyperbeläste G = — i enthalten. Eine durch den Nullpunkt 
gehende, gerade Weltlinie kann zur ::i;-Achse oder zur /-Achse gemacht 
werden, je nachdem sie in den Quadranten G '^ o oder G <^ o ver- 
läuft; dem entsprechend unterscheidet man die Weltlinien in > raumartige« 
und »zeitartige«. 

In irgend einem Inertialsystem trennt die :r-Achse die Weltpunkte 
der »Vergangenheit« (/ <^ o) von denen der »Zukunft« (/ ^ o). Aber 
für jedes Inertialsystem ist diese Scheidung eine andere; denn für eine 

andere Lage der Jir-Achse fallen 
Weltpunkte, die vorher oberhalb 
der :3ic-Achse, also in der »Zu- 
kunft«, lagen, nun unterhalb der 
A:-Achse, also in die Vergangenheit, 
und umgekehrt. Nur die durch 
Weltpunkte innerhalb der Quadran- 
ten G<C.o dargestellten Ereignisse 
sind für jedes Inertialsystem ein- 
deutig entweder »vergangen« oder 
»zukünftig«. Für einen solchen 

Weltpunkt F ist /^>-^, d. h. in 

jedem zulässigen Bezugsystem ist 

der Zeitabstand der beiden Ereig- 

Abb. 122. nisse O und /^größer als die Zeit, 

die das Licht braucht, um von 
einem Orte zum andern zu laufen. Man kann dann immer ein solches 
Inertialsystem S einführen, dessen /-Achse durch P geht, in dem P also 
ein am räumlichen Nullpunkte stattfindendes Ereignis darstellt; von einem 
andern Inertialsystem aus beurteilt, wird sich dieses System S geradlinig 
und gleichförmig so bewegen, daß sein Nullpunkt gerade mit den Er- 
eignissen O und P koinzidiert. Dann ist offenbar für das Ereignis P im 
System S x = Oj also G = — c^t^ <I o. 

In jedem Inertialsystem scheidet die /-Achse die Weltpunkte, denen 




Die Addition der Geschwindigkeiten. igy 

>vor« oder »hinter« dem räumlichen Nullpunkte auf der A:-Achse statt- 
findende Ereignisse entsprechen. Aber für ein anderes Inertialsystem 
mit anderer /-Achse ist diese Scheidung offenbar eine andere; nur für 
die innerhalb der Quadranten G ^ o gelegenen Weltpunkte ist es ein- 
deutig bestimmt, ob sie »vor« oder »hinter« dem räumlichen Nullpunkte 

liegen. Für einen solchen Punkt /* ist / <C ~t 5 ^- ^' ^^ jedem zulässigen 

Bezugsystem ist der Zeitabstand der beiden Ereignisse O und P kleiner 
als die Laufzeit des Lichtes zwischen ihnen. Dann kann man ein ge- 
eignet bewegtes Inertialsystem S einführen, dessen A:-Achse durch F geht, 
indem also die beiden Ereignisse O und F gleichzeitig sind. In diesem 
System ist offenbar für das Ereignis /> / = o, also G = x^ "^ o. 

Daraus geht hervor, daß die Invariante G für jeden Weltpunkt F eine 
meßbare Größe von anschaulicher Bedeutung ist; entweder läßt sich P 
mit O »auf gleichen Ort transformieren«, dann ist G = — c'^t^, wo / 
der Zeitunterschied des Ereignisses F gegen das an derselben Raumstelle 
des Systems S stattfindende Ereignis O ist, oder F läßt sich mit O »auf 
Gleichzeitigkeit« transformieren, dann ist G = x^^ wo ^ der räumliche 
Abstand der beiden im System S gleichzeitigen Ereignisse ist. 

Die Lichtlinien G = o stellen in jedem Koordinatensystem Bewegungen 
mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit dar. Daher entspricht jeder zeitartigen Welt- 
linie eine Bewegung mit kleinerer Geschwindigkeit; jede Bewegung mit 
Unterlichtgeschwindigkeit kann »auf Ruhe transformiert« werden, weil zu 
ihr eine zeitartige Weltlinie gehört. 

Was gilt nun aber für Bewegungen mit Überlichtgeschwindigkeit? 

Es ist nach dem Vorangehenden wohl klar, daß die Einsteinsche 
Relativitätstheorie solche für physikalisch unmöglich erklären muß. Denn 
die neue Kinematik verhert allen Sinn, wenn es Signale gäbe, die die 
Gleichzeitigkeit von Uhren mit Überlichtgeschwindigkeit zu kontrollieren 
erlaubten. 

Hier scheint sich eine Schwierigkeit zu erheben. 

Angenommen, ein System S' hätte die Geschwindigkeit v gegen ein 
anderes 5; ein bewegter Körper K bewege sich relativ zu 6" mit der 
Geschwindigkeit u. Nach der gewöhnlichen Kinematik ist dann die 
relative Geschwindigkeit des Körpers K gegen S 

Wenn nun sowohl v^ als auch u die Hälfte der Lichtgeschwindigkeit 
übertreffen, so ist u = v -{- u größer als c^ was nach der Relativitäts- 
theorie unmöglich sein soll. 

Natürlich beruht dieser Widerspruch darauf, daß man in der Kinematik 
des Relativitätsprinzips, wo jedes Bezugsystem eigene Längen- und Zeit- 
einheiten hat, Geschwindigkeiten nicht einfach addieren darf. 

Man sieht das schon daraus , daß in irgend zwei gegeneinander be- 
wegten Bezugsystemen die Lichtgeschwindigkeit immer denselben Wert

hat; gerade diese Tatsache haben wir früher zur Ableitung der Lorentz- 
Transformation benützt (VI, 2, S. 178), und die dort aufgestellte Formel (7c), 
S. 179, liefert das richtige Gesetz für die Zusammensetzung der Geschwin- 

digkeiten, wenn man darin «^ — i =-ß^ = — ^ einführt. Wir ziehen es 

vor, diese Regel nochmals aus der Lorentz-Transformation (72), S. 180, 
abzuleiten; dazu dividieren wir die Ausdrücke für x' und y (oder z'] 
durch den für /':

Das entsprechende gilt erst recht für transversale, überhaupt für beliebige 
Bewegung. 

Die Lichtgeschwindigkeit ist daher kinematisch eine unüberschreitbare 
Grenze. Diese Behauptung der Einsteinschen Theorie hat viel Wider- 
spruch gefunden; sie schien eine unberechtigte Beschränkung für zukünftige 
Entdecker, die Bewegungen mit Überlichtgeschwindigkeit suchen wollten. 

Man kennt ja in den /^-Strahlen der radioaktiven Substanzen Elektronen 
von nahezu Lichtgeschwindigkeit; warum sollte es nicht möglich sein, 
diese so zu beschleunigen, daß sie Überlichtgeschwindigkeit erreichen? 

Die Einsteinsche Theorie behauptet nun, daß das prinzipiell nicht 
möglich sei, weil der Trägheitswiderstand oder die Masse eines Körpers 
um so größer ist, je mehr sich seine Geschwindigkeit der des Lichtes 
annähert. Wir gelangen damit zu der neuen Dynamik^ die sich auf der 
Einsteinschen Kinematik autbaut. 

7. Die Einsteinsche Dynamik. 

Die Galilei-Newtonsche Mechanik ist aufs engste mit der alten 
Kinematik verknüpft; das klassische Relativitätsprinzip beruht insbesondere 
auf der Tatsache, daß Geschwindigkeitsänderungen, Beschleunigungen, 
gegen Galilei-Transformationen invariant sind. 

Man kann nun natürlich nicht für einen Teil des Naturgeschehens 
die eine, für einen andern Teil die andere Kinematik annehmen, für die 
Mechanik die Invarianz bei Galilei-Transformationen, für die Elektro- 
dynamik die Invarianz bei Lorentz-Transformationen fordern. 

Nun wissen wir, daß erstere ein Grenzfall der letzteren sind, durch 
unendlich große Werte der Konstanten c gekennzeichnet. Daher werden 
wir mit Einstein annehmen, daß die klassische Mechanik gar nicht streng 
gilt, sondern einer Abänderung bedarf; die Gesetze der neuen Mechanik 
müssen gegen Lorentz-Transformationen invariant sein. 

Bei der Aufstellung dieser Gesetze muß man sich entscheiden, welche 
Grundsätze der klassischen Mechanik beizubehalten sind, welche ver- 
worfen oder abgeändert werden müssen. Das Grundgesetz der Dynamik, 
von dem wir ausgegangen sind, ist der Impulssatz^ ausgedrückt durch die 
Formel (7) (II, 9, S. 27): J •=■ mw. Es ist klar, daß man ihn in dieser 
Form nicht ohne weiteres aufrecht erhalten kann. Denn während in der 
klassischen Mechanik die Geschwindigkeitsänderung w für verschiedene 
Inertialsysteme immer denselben Wert hat (s. III, 5, S. 54), ist das hier 
wegen des Einsteinschen Additionstheorems der Geschwindigkeiten (77) 
nicht der Fall; die Formel (7) hat also ohne besondere Vorschriften für 
die Umrechnung (Transformation) des Impulses von einem Bezugsystem 
auf ein anderes gar keinen Sinn, und darum ist es nicht zweckmäßig, 
von ihr aus durch Verallgemeinerung das neue Grundgesetz zu suchen. 

Wohl aber kann man von dem Erhaltungssatz des Impulses [II, 9, 
S. 28, Formel (9)] ausgehen; dieser betrifift den gesamten, von zwei Kör- 



200 I^3.s spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

pern mitgeführten Impuls und besagt, daß dieser bei einem Zusammen- 
stoß der Körper erhalten bleibt, wie sich auch die Geschwindigkeiten 
dabei ändern. Es handelt sich also um eine Aussage, die zwei aufeinander 
wirkende Körper allein angeht, um einen gegenseitigen Stoß, ohne Ein- 
wirkung von außen, also auch ohne Bezugnahme auf dritte Körper oder 
Koordinatensysteme. Man wird daher verlangen, daß dieser Erhaltungs- 
satz auch in der neuen Dynamik gültig bleiben soll. 

Allerdings ist das, wie wir sogleich sehen werden, nicht möglich, wenn 
man an dem Grundsatz der klassischen Mechanik festhält, daß die Masse 
eine für jeden Körper eigentümliche, konstante Größe ist. Daher werden 
wir von vornherein annehmen, daß die Masse ein und desselben Körpers 
eine relative Größe ist; sie soll verschiedene 'Werte haben, je nach dem 
Bezugsystem, von dem aus man sie beurteilt, oder von einem bestimmten 
Bezugsystem aus je nach der Geschwindigkeit des bewegten Körpers. Es 
ist einleuchtend, daß die Masse bezüglich eines bestimmten Bezugsystems 
nur von dem Betrage der Geschwindigkeit des bewegten Körpers gegen 
dieses System abhängen kann. 

Wir betrachten nun zwei Bezugsysteme S und 6", die sich relativ 
zueinander geradlinig mit der Geschwindigkeit v bewegen. Auf S sei 
ein Beobachter A^ auf S' ein Beobachter B. Diese seien mit zwei ganz 
gleichen Kugeln versehen; die Kugel von A habe also bezüglich des 
Systems ^S dieselbe Masse, wie die Kugel B bezüglich 6", sofern die 
relativen Bewegungen nur dieselben sind. 

Nun sollen die beiden Beobachter die Kugeln einander zuwerfen, und 
zwar jeder in der auf seiner Bewegung senkrechten Richtung auf den 
andern hin; dabei sollen sie den Augenblick des Wurfs so abpassen, daß 
die beiden Kugeln sich im Fluge genau symmetrisch treffen, d. h. so, daß 
die Verbindungslinie ihrer Mittelpunkte im Augenblick des Zusammen- 
stoßes auf der Bewegungsrichtung von S und S' gegeneinander senk- 
recht steht. 

Bezeichnen wir mit up^ und Us^ die longitudinale und transversale 
Geschwindigkeitskomponente der ersten Kugel, mit up^ , Us^ die der 
zweiten, so kann man angeben, wie diese Größen, gemessen in einem der 
beiden Bezugsysteme S oder S' ^ sich vor und nach dem Stoße verhalten. 

Die erste Kugel wird von A transversal bezüglich S mit einer rela- 
tiven Geschwindigkeit U fortgeschleudert; daher ist 
(78) Up^=0, Us, = U, 

Ebenso schleudert B seine Kugel bezüglich S' in der entgegen- 
gesetzten Richtung mit derselben Relativgeschwindigkeit U\ es ist also 

«^2 = ° ) ^'s2 = — ^' 

Nun kann man diese Größen nach dem Additionstheorem (77), S. 198, 

jeweils aaf das andere System umrechnen; wir begnügen uns mit der 

Angabe aller Komponenten im System S, fügen aber sogleich hinzu, daß 

die Rechnung im System S' zu genau demselben Schlußresultate führt, 



Die Einsteinsche Dynamik.

Will man nun den gesamten Impuls vor dem Stoße berechnen, so 
ist es vorteilhaft, nicht erst den Versuch zu machen, die Massen der beiden 
gleichen, aber verschieden bewegten Kugeln als gleich anzusetzen; denn 
es wird sich sogleich ergeben, daß sie notwendig verschieden sein müssen. 
Bezeichnen wir also die Massen vor dem Stoß bezüglich S mit Wj, w,, 
so hat der gesamte Impuls vor dem Stoß die Komponenten

Nun betrachten wir die Wirkung des Stoßes. 

Da dieser genau symmetrisch erfolgen soll, so kann weder vom System S 
aus beurteilt die longitudinale Geschwindigkeit der ersten Kugel durch 
den Stoß sich ändern, noch vom System S* aus beurteilt die der zweiten. 
Überhaupt muß aus Symmetriegründen der Beobachter A an seiner Kugel 
genau denselben Bewegungsvorgang sehen, wie B an der seinen. Die 
transversalen Geschwindigkeitskomponenten werden sich bei dem Stoße 
ändern; die erste Kugel möge, von S aus gemessen, die der ursprüng- 
lichen entgegen gerichtete Geschwindigkeit — U' annehmen, dann muß

gerichtet ist. Man hat daher nach dem Stoße

Das spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



Wäre nun die Masse konstant, also in^ = m^ =m^z= m^^ so würde 
zwar die erste Gleichung identisch richtig sein, die zweite aber würde 
auf einen Widerspruch führen. Denn dann würde aus ihr folgen, daß 



t/+f/')(i-|/i-J) = o 



ist, und das ist unmöglich, weil U und v sicher nicht Null sind. 

Wir müssen also den Grundsatz der klassischen Mechanik von der 
Konstanz der Masse fallen lassen und ersetzen ihn durch die schon oben 
genannte Annahme, daß die Masse eines Körpers bezüglich eines Systems S 
von dem Betrage seiner Geschwindigkeit relativ zu diesem System ab- 
hängt. 

Man kann den Betrag u der Geschwindigkeit aus den Komponenten 
up und Us nach der Formel (3) (II, 3, S. 21) berechnen: 



Danach erhält man für die Geschwindigkeiten der beiden Kugeln

Nun verlangt die erste Gleichung {84), daß m^ = m^ ist; wenn die 

Masse überhaupt mit der Geschwindigkeit veränderlich ist, so kann nur 

dann m^ = m^ sein, wenn die entsprechende Geschwindigkeit ti^ vor 
und nach dem Stoße ungeändtrt bleibt: 

Daraus folgt aber U •= U' . 

Sodann zeigen die Gleichungen (85), daß auch 11^ beim Stoße un- 
geändert bleibt, und daraus folgt m^ = m^. 

Daher kann man jetzt die zweite Gleichung (84) so schreiben:

Denken wir uns nun die Wurfgeschwindigkeit U immer kleiner und 
kleiner gewählt; dann wird schließlich nach (85) //^^ = o, ti^ = v. Als- 
dann ist m^ die Masse, die der Geschwindigkeit Null entspricht und die 
man Ruhmasse m^ nennt, während m^ die der Geschwindigkeit v entspre- 
chende Masse ist, die wir mit m schlechtweg bezeichnen. Es gilt also

Damit ist die Abhängigkeit der relativistischen Masse von der Ge-

Man kann nun nachträglich leicht einsehen, daß durch diesen An- 
satz (87) die allgemeine Gleichung (86) für beliebige Wurfgeschwindig- 
keiten U erfüllt wird, denn es ist nach (85)

Von diesem kann man zu dem Bewegungsgesetze für kontinuierlich 
wirkende Kräfte übergehen. Man muß dabei diejenige Formulierung der 
klassischen Mechanik (II, 10, S. 29) benutzen, die sich auf den mitge- 
führten Impuls stützt; sie läßt sich offenbar ohne weiteres auf die neue 
Dynamik übertragen, nur muß man das Gesetz für die longitudinale und 
transversale Komponente gesondert formulieren: 

Eine Kraft K erzeugt eine Änderung des mitgeführten Impulses^ und 
zwar ist die pro Zeiteinheit berechnete Änderung der lo?igitudinalen bzw. 
transversalen Impulskomponente gleich der entsprechenden Kraft komponente. 

Hiernach lassen sich leicht die Bewegungsgleichungen aufstellen.

Der Zusammenhang zwischen Kraft und erzeugter Beschleunigung ist 
also ein anderer, je nachdem die Kraft in der Richtung der schon vor- 
handenen Beschleunigung oder senkrecht dazu wirkt. 

Man pflegt diese Formeln auf eine Gestalt zu bringen, in der sie dem 
Grundgesetz der klassischen Dynamik fll, 10, Formel (10), S. 29] mög- 
lichst ähnlich sehen. Dazu setzt man

(91) Kp=^mpbp^ Ks = msbs^ 

in formaler Übereinstimmung mit dem klassischen Grundgesetz. 

Man sieht hier, wie notwendig es ist, den Massenbegriff von Anfang 
an ausschließlich durch den Trägheitswiderstand zu definieren; sonst wäre 
es nicht möglich ihn in der relativistischen Mechanik anzuwenden, denn für 



Hiervon sind die ursprünglichen Impulse

2o6 Das spezielle Eiusteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



den mitgeführten Impuls, für longitudinale und transversale Kräfte kommt 
jedesmal ein anderer Ausdruck »Masse« in Betracht, und diese Massen 
sind überdies- nicht charakteristische Konstanten des Körpers, sondern 
hängen von seiner Geschwindigkeit ab. Der Massenbegriff der Einstein- 
schen Dynamik entfernt sich also sehr weit von dem Sprachgebrauch, 
wo Masse irgendwie Quantität der Materie bedeutet. Ein Maß dafür ist 
in gewissem Sinne die Ruhmasse m^'^ aber diese ist wiederum nicht, wie 
die Masse der gewöhnlichen Mechanik, in einem beliebigen Bezugsystem 
gleich dem Verhältnis von Impuls zu Geschwindigkeit oder von Kraft zu 
Beschleunigung. 

Ein Blick auf die Massenformeln (87) und (90) lehrt, daß die Werte 
der relativistischen Masse m (bzw. mp und m^ um so größer werden, je 
mehr sich die Geschwindigkeit v des bewegten Körpers der Lichtge- 
schwindigkeit nähert. Für v = c wird die Masse unendlich groß. 

Daraus folgt, daß es unmöglich ist, mit endlichen Kräften einen 
Körper auf Überlichtgeschwindigkeit zu bringen; sein Trägh ei ts wider- 
stand wächst ins Unendliche an und verhindert die Erreichung der Licht- 
geschwindigkeit. 

Hier sieht man, wie die Einsteinsche Theorie sich harmonisch zu 
einem einheitlichen Ganzen abrundet; die fast paradox erscheinende An- 
nahme einer unüberschreitbaren Grenzgeschwindigkeit wird durch die 
Naturgesetze in der neuen Form selbst gefordert. 

Die Formel (87) für die Abhängigkeit der Masse von der Geschwindig- 
keit ist dieselbe, die schon Lorentz durch elektrodynamische Rechnungen 
für sein abgeplattetes Elektron gefunden hatte; dabei drückte sich m^ 
durch die elektrostatische Energie U des ruhenden Elektrons ebenso aus, 
wie in der Abrahamschen Theorie [V, 13, S. 160, Formel (69)], nämlich 

4 ^ 
^0 = 37.- 

Wir sehen jetzt, daß der Lorentzschen Massenformel eine viel allgemeinere 
Bedeutung zukommt. Sie muß für jede Art von Masse gelten, gleich- 
gültig, ob diese elektrodynamischen Ursprungs ist oder nicht. 

Die neueren Untersuchungen über die Ablenkung der Kathodenstrahlen 
scheinen dafür zu sprechen, daß die Lorentzsche Formel besser stimmt 
als die Abrahamsche. Eine überraschende Bestätigung der relativistischen 
Massenformel aber ist auf einem Gebiete gewonnen worden, das der 
Relativitätstheorie ganz fernzuliegen scheint, nämlich die Spektroskopie 
der Licht- und Röntgenstrahlen. 

Wir können diese wunderbaren Zusammenhänge nur mit wenigen 
Worten streifen. Das Leuchten der Atome kommt dadurch zustande, 
daß Elektronen innerhalb des Atomverbandes schwingende Bewegungen 
ausführen und elektromagnetische Wellen erzeugen, die sich nach allen 
Seiten fortpflanzen. Die ältere Theorie berechnete diese Vorgänge mit 
Hilfe der Maxwellschen Feldgleichungen; neuerdings sah man sich aber 



Die Trägheit der Energie. 207 



gezwungen, die strenge Gültigkeit dieser im Atominnern aufzugeben und 
andere Gesetzmäßigkeiten anzunehmen, die zum ersten Male von Max 
Planck (1900) in der Theorie der Wärmestrahlung eingeführt worden sind. 
Das ist die sogenannte Quantentheorie. Niels Bohr hat diese (1913) zur 
Erklärung der Spektren herangezogen und große Erfolge erzielt. Ohne auf 
Einzelheiten einzugehen, bemerken wir nur, daß bei schnellen Bewegungen 
der Elektronen die Masse nach der Einsteinschen Relativitätstheorie ver- 
größert sein muß, und das wird einen Einfluß auf die Spektren haben. 
Tatsächlich hat Sommerfeld (191 5) zeigen können, daß infolge der 
Massenveränderlichkeit die Spektrallinien eine verwickelte Struktur haben; 
jede Linie besteht in Wahrheit aus einem ganzen System stärkerer und 
feinerer Linien. Bei den sichtbaren Spektren, die von den äußeren 
Elektronen des Atoms ausgesandt werden, ist diese Liniengruppe sehr eng, 
es handelt sich um eine »Feinstruktur«; bei den Röntgenspektren, die aus 
dem Atominnern stammen, aber ist es eine Grobstruktur von millionen- 
mal größerer Aufspaltung. Die von Sommerfeld berechnete Feinstruktur 
der Linien des Wasserstoff- und Heliumspektrums ist von Paschen (191 6) 
beobachtet worden; auch bei den Röntgenspektren haben sich diese An- 
sätze gut bewährt. Sie stimmen so genau, daß der Unterschied der 
Massenformeln von Abraham und Lorentz, der eine Größe 2. Ordnung 
in ß ist, dafür in Betracht kommt; Sommerfelds Schüler Glitscher hat 
(191 7) zeigen können, daß die Abrahamsche Formel mit den Beobach- 
tungen am Heliumspektrum nicht vereinbar ist, wohl aber die Lorentzsche. 
Man kann daher von einer spektroskopischen Bestätigung der Einsteinschen 
Relativitätstheorie sprechen. 

Da jede Masse nach der Formel {87) von der Geschwindigkeit ab- 
hängt, so wird der Beweis für die elektromagnetische Natur der Masse 
des Elektrons hinfällig, damit zugleich auch der Zusammenhang zwischen 
Ruhmasse und elektrostatischer Energie. Die Lorentzsche Theorie des 
ruhenden Äthers konnte den Versuch machen, die mechanische Massen- 
trägheit auf das eigenartige Beharrungsvermögen des elektromagnetischen 
Feldes zurückzuführen; wenn die Einsteinsche Relativitätstheorie diesen 
großen Plan aufgeben müßte, so würde ihr das jeder, dem die Einheit 
der Natur am Herzen liegt, zum Nachteil anrechnen. Aber die neue 
Dynamik hat auch hier nicht versagt, sondern die tiefste Aufklärung über 
das Wesen der trägen Masse gebracht. 

8. Die Trägheit der Energie. 

Für alle praktischen Zwecke, auch für die schnellsten Elektronen, ge- 
nügt es, die Massenformel {87) bis auf Glieder von höherer als 2. Ordnung 
anzuschreiben. Nun ist, wie wir früher gesehen haben (S. 164, Anmer- 
kung), mit dieser Annäherung 



2o8 I^^s spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 



Daher wird 






In der .gewöhnlichen Mechanik ist die kinetische Energie (II, 14, S. 39) 

definiert durch 7 = w_ — ; aus unserer Formel folgt dafür der Ausdruck 

2 

T =■ c^ [m — Wq) . 

Man kann zeigen, daß diese Definition der kinetischen Energie streng 
gültig ist, auch wenn man die Glieder von höherer als 2. Ordnung nicht 
vernachlässigt. 

Der Energiesatz [II, 14, Formel (16), S. 39] verlangt, daß die zeitliche 
Änderung der Energie E = T-{- U während der Bewegung dauernd Null 

ist. Dabei muß man hier statt des klassischen Wertes 7= — v^ den

wo die longitudinale Kraftkomponente nach (89), S. 205 eingeführt ist. 
Die rechte Seite ist aber die negative zeitliche Änderung der potentiellen

man die Kraft als näherungsweise konstant ansehen und so verfahren,

als ob es sich um die Schwerkraft handelte, deren potentielle Energie 
[II, 14, Formel (15), S. 37] gleich Gx war; dabei war die Richtung x 
der Schwere entgegen angenommen, so daß (9 = — Kp gesetzt werden 
muß. Die zeitliche Änderung der potentiellen Energie wird dann 

Mithin drückt die Gleichung (93) tatsächlich aus, daß die Größe 
E = T-\- U zeitlich konstant ist, wobei T den Ausdruck (92) bedeutet. 
Schreibt man die Formel (92) 

so sagt sie aus, daß die Masse sich von ihrem Werte bei Ruhe gerade 
um so viel unterscheidet, als die durch das Quadrat der Lichtgeschwindig- 
keit geteilte kinetische Energie beträgt. 

Diese Formulierung legt den Gedanken nahe, daß die Ruhmasse m^ 
in derselben Weise mit dem Energieinhalte des ruhenden Körpers zu- 
sammenhängt, daß also überhaupt zwischen jeder Masse und Energie 
die universelle Beziehung 

(94) ^ "^ 7^ 

besteht. Einstein hat dieses Gesetz von der Trägheit der Energie als das 
wichtigste Ergebnis der Relativitätstheorie bezeichnet; bedeutet es doch 
die Identität der beiden fundamentalen Begriffe von Masse und Energie 
und eröffnet dadurch die tiefsten Einblicke in die Struktur der Materie. 
Ehe wir hiervon berichten, teilen wir den einfachen, von Einstein ge- 
gebenen Beweis der Formel (94) mit. 

Dieser stützt sich auf die Tatsache der Existenz des Strahlungs- 
druckes. Daß eine Lichtwelle, die auf einen absorbierenden Körper auf- 
trifft, auf diesen einen Druck ausübt, folgt aus den Maxwellschen Feld- 
gleichungen mit Hilfe eines von Poynting (1884) zuerst abgeleiteten Satzes; 
und zwar ergibt sich, daß der Impuls, der von einem kurzen Lichtblitz 
oder Lichtstoß von der Energie E auf die absorbierende Fläche ausgeübt 

wird, gleich — ist. Dieses Resultat ist experimentell von Lebedew (1890) 

und später mit größerer Genauigkeit von Nichols und Hüll (1901) be- 
stätigt worden. Genau denselben Druck erfährt ein Körper, der Licht 
aussendet, ebenso wie ein Geschütz beim Abschuß einen Rückstoß be- 
kommt. 

Wir denken uns nun einen Hohlkörper, etwa ein langes Rohr, und in 
diesem an den Enden zwei gleich große Körper A^ B aus gleichem Material, 
die also nach den gewöhnlichen Vorstellungen die gleiche Masse haben 
(Abb. 123). Der Körper A soll aber einen Energieüberschuß E über B 

Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. y± 



2 1 o Das spezielle Einsteinsclie Relativitätsprinzip. 

haben, etwa in der Form von Wärme, und es soll eine Einrichtung (Hohl- 
spiegel oder dergleichen) vorhanden sein, um diese Energie E in der Form 
von Strahlung nach B zu senden. Die räumliche Ausdehnung dieses 
Lichtblitzes sei klein gegen die Länge / des Rohres. 

Dann erfährt A den Rückstoß -^; also bekommt das ganze Rohr, 

c 

dessen gesamte Masse M sei, eine nach rückwärts gerichtete Geschwindig- 
keit 27, die sich aus der Impulsgleichung 

E 



Ä B% 



Mv = 



Abb. 123. bestimmt. Diese Bewegung hält an, bis 

der Lichtblitz bei B angekommen und 
dort absorbiert ist; dabei erfährt B denselben Stoß nach vorn, das 
ganze System kommt daher zur Ruhe. Die Verrückung, die es während 
der Laufzeit / des Lichtblitzes erfahren hat, ist x = vt^ wo v aus obiger 
Gleichung zu entnehmen ist, also 

Et 



X 



Mc 

Die Laufzeit ist aber (bis auf einen kleinen Fehler höherer Ordnung) 
durch l ■= et bestimmt; daher wird die Verrückung 

El 



X 



Mc' 



Nun kann raan die Körper A^B miteinander vertauschen, und zwar ohne 
Anwendung äußerer Einwirkungen; man stelle sich etwa vor, daß zwei 
im Rohre befindliche Männer A an die Stelle von B^ B an die Stelle 
von A bringen und dann selbst an ihren ursprünglichen Platz zurückkehren. 
Nach der gewöhnlichen Mechanik müßte dabei das ganze Rohr keine 
Verschiebung erfahren; denn dauernde Ortsveränderungen können nur 
durch äußere Kräfte bewirkt werden. 

Ist diese Vertauschung ausgeführt, so wäre im Inneren des Rohres 
alles wie zu Anfang, die Energie E wieder an derselben Stelle wie vorher, 
die Massenverteilung genau die gleiche. Aber das ganze Rohr wäre gegen 
seine Ausgangslage durch den Lichtstoß um die Strecke.:;»: verrückt. Das 
widerspricht natürlich allen Grundsätzen der Mechanik. Man könnte ja 
den Prozeß wiederholen und dadurch dem System ohne Anwendung äußerer 
Kräfte eine beliebige Ortsveränderung erteilen. Das ist unmöglich. Der 
einzige Ausweg ist die Annahme, daß bei der Vertauschung von A und B 
diese beiden Körper nicht mechanisch gleichwertig sind, sondern daß B 
infolge seines um E höheren Energiegehaltes eine um m größere Masse 
als A habe. Dann bleibt bei der Vertauschung nicht alles symmetrisch, 
sondern es wird die Masse m von rechts nach links um die Strecke / ver- 
schoben. Dabei verschiebt sich das ganze Rohr um eine Strecken in der 
umgekehrten Richtung; sie bestimmt sich daraus, daß der Vorgang ohne 



Die Trägheit der Energie. ' 211 



äußere Kraftwirkung vor sich geht. Der Gesamtimpuls, bestehend aus 

X i 

dem des Rohres M — und dem der transportierten Masse — m — , ist 

also Null: 

Mx — ml = o\ 
daraus folgt: 

ml 

Diese Verrückung muß nun die durch den Lichtstoß erzeugte gerade 
aufheben; also muß 

ml El 

sein. Hieraus kann man m berechnen und findet 

E 

m = —^ • 
c 

Das ist der Betrag an träger Masse, den man der Energie E zu- 
schreiben muß, damit der Grundsatz der Mechanik gültig bleibt, daß ohne 
Wirkung äußerer Kräfte keine Ortsveränderungen eintreten können. 

Da schließlich jede Energie auf Umwegen in Strahlung verwandelbar 
ist, muß der Satz universelle Gültigkeit haben. Masse ist danach nichts 
als eine Erscheinungsform der Energie\ die Materie selber verliert ihren 
primären Charakter als unzerstörbare Substanz, sie ist nichts als eine Zu- 
sammenballung von Energie. Wo elektrische und magnetische Felder oder 
andere Wirkungen zu starken Energieanhäufungen führen, da kommt die 
Erscheinung der Massenträgkeit zustande. Das Elektron und die Atome 
sind solche Stellen ungeheurer Energiekonzentration. 

Wir können von den zahlreichen und wichtigen Folgerungen dieses 
Satzes nur wenige kurz berühren. 

Was zunächst die Masse des Elektrons betrifft, so zeigt die Formel (69), 

S. 160, für die Ruhmasse ;«o = I —^ , daß die elektrostatische Energie U 

nicht die gesamte Energie E des ruhenden Elektrons sein kann; es 
muß noch ein anderer Energieanteil V vorhanden sein, E^=U-\- F, 
derart, daß 



m^ 



^^ U ^E __ U-\- V

wird. Daraus folgt V = \U — U ^= \U ^= \E\ die gesamte Energie 

ist also zu drei Vierteln elektrostatisch, zu einem Viertel von anderer 

Art. Dieser Anteil muß von den Kohäsionskräften herrühren, die das % 

Elektron gegen die elektrostatische Anziehung zusammenhalten. Hierüber ^ 

sind bereits sehr tief eindringende Theorien von Mie, Hilbert und ^ i'£^'V),>^ 



14*

Einstein entwickelt worden, doch sind die Ergebnisse noch zu unbe- 
friedigend, als daß hier darüber berichtet werden könnte. Am aussichts- 
reichsten erscheinen die Ansätze Einsteins, auf die wir bei der Besprechung 
der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie noch einmal kurz zurückkommen 
werden. 

Dagegen ist der Satz von der Trägheit der Energie bereits jetzt von 
größter Wichtigkeit für das Problem des Aufbaus der materiellen Atome. 

Wir haben oben (S. 154) berichtet, daß jedes Atom aus einem posi- 
tiven Anteil besteht, der mit der trägen Masse untrennbar verbunden 
ist, und aus einer Anzahl negativer Elektronen. Durch Versuche von 
Rutherford (1913) und seinen Schülern über die Zerstreuung der von 
radioaktiven Substanzen emittierten positiven Strahlen, den sogenannten 
a-Strahlen, wurde der Beweis erbracht, daß die positiven Bestandteile 
der Atome, die man heute •»Kerne'!- nennt, außerordentlich klein sind, 
viel kleiner sogar als das Elektron, dessen Radius wir (S. 161) auf etwa 
2«io~^^cm geschätzt haben. Wenn nun die Masse des Kerns, wie die 
des Elektrons, in der Hauptsache (zu drei Vierteln) elektromagnetischer 
Natur wäre, so müßte zwischen ihr und dem Radius a eine Formel ähnlich 

wie die früher (S. 160) auf das Elektron angewandte w^ = | — ^be- 
stehen, nur vielleicht mit etwas anderem Zahlenfaktor. Die Massen wären 
also den Radien umgekehrt proportional: 

Radius des Elektrons Masse des Kerns 

Radius des Kerns Masse des Elektrons 

Nun wissen wir, daß das Wasserstoffatom etwa 2000 mal träger ist 
als das Elektron; daraus folgt, daß der Radius des Wasserstoff kerns etwa 
2 000 mal kleiner ist als der des Elektrons, in guter Übereinstimmung mit 
den experimentellen Ergebnissen. 

Man kann also den Satz von der Trägheit der Energie mit Erfolg 
auf die Massen der Atome oder Kerne anwenden. 

Die radioaktiven Atome zerfallen bekanntlich unter Aussendung von 
drei Arten von Strahlen: i. «-Strahlen, das sind positiv geladene Teilchen, 
die sich als Heliumkerne erwiesen haben; 2. /^-Strahlen, das sind Elek- 
tronen; 3. /-Strahlen, das sind elektromagnetische Wellen von der Natur 
der Röntgenstrahlen. Bei dieser Emission verliert das Atom nicht nur 
direkt Masse, sondern außerdem Energie von beträchtlicher Größe; aber 
mit dem Energieverlust ist nach dem Satze von der Trägheit der Energie 
wiederum eine Massenabnahme verknüpft. Leider ist diese so klein, daß 
es vorläufig noch nicht gelungen ist, sie experimentell zu bestimmen. 

Prinzipiell ist aber die Erkenntnis von großer Bedeutung, daß bei dem 
Zerfall eines Atoms die Massen der Bestandteile zusammengezählt nicht 
gleich der Masse des ursprünglichen Atoms sind. Denn es ist ein altes 
Ziel der Forschung, alle Atome in einfachere Urbestandteile zu zerlegen. 
Pr out (18 15) hat die Hypothese aufgestellt, daß diese Urbestandteile die 



Optik bewegter Körper. 213 



Wasserstoffatome sind; er begründet diese Idee durch den Hinweis, daß 
die Gewichte vieler Atome ganzzahlige Vielfache des Gewichts des Wasser- 
stoffatoms sind. Die genaue Messung der Atomgewicht'2 hat aber diese 
Behauptung nicht bestätigt, wodurch die Proutsche Hypothese in Miß- 
kredit kam. Heute aber wird sie mit Erfolg wieder aufgenommen; denn 
nach dem Satze von der Trägheit der Energie wird die Masse eines aus 
n Wasserstoff kernen gebildeten Atomkerns nicht einfach gleich «mal der 
Masse des Wasserstoff kern es sein, sondern um den bei der Vereinigung um- 
gesetzten Energiebetrag anders. Neuerdings hat nun diese Auffassung eine 
große Stütze gefunden durch die Entdeckung Rutherfords (191 9), daß 
man von Stickstoffatomen Wasserstoff kerne durch ein Bombardement mit 
a-Strahlen abspalten kann. Allerdings kann der Satz von der Trägheit 
der Energie nur kleine Abweichungen der Ganzzahligkeit des Verhält- 
nisses der Atomgewichte zu dem des Wasserstoffs erklären; aber es gibt 
noch eine andere Ursache, die die groben Differenzen hervorruft, die 
Tatsache der Isotopen. Viele Elemente sind Gemische von Atomen mit 
gleichgeladenen Kernen und gleicher Anordnung der Elektronen, aber 
verschiedener Kernmasse ; diese lassen sich chemisch nicht trennen, wohl 
aber physikalisch. Die Existenz der Isotopen wurde zuerst bei radio- 
aktiven Substanzen und neuerdings durch Aston (1920) bei vielen anderen 
Elementen erwiesen. Doch können wir hier auf dieses interessante Thema 
nicht eingehen. 

Dieser Ausblick auf die Probleme der modernen Atomistik zeigt aufs 
eindringlichste, daß die Einsteinsche Relativitätstheorie keine Ausgeburt 
phantastischer Spekulation, sondern ein Wegweiser im wichtigsten For- 
schungsgebiete der Physik ist. Die Entschleierung des Geheimnisses der 
Welt der Atome bedeutet ein Ziel für die geistige Entwicklung der 
Menschheit, das an Großartigkeit und Folgenschwere alle anderen Auf- 
gaben der Naturwissenschaft übertrifft, vielleicht sogar die Erkenntnis vom 
Bau des Weltalls. Denn jeder Schritt zu diesem Ziele gibt uns nicht nur 
neue Waffen im Kampfe ums Dasein, sondern bringt uns Wissen von 
den tiefsten Zusammenhängen der natürlichen Welt und lehrt uns schei- 
den zwischen dem Trug der Sinne und der Wahrheit der ewigen Ge- 
setze des Alls. 

9. Optik bewegter Körper. 

Nachdem wir die wichtigsten Folgerungen aus der abgeänderten Mecha- 
nik gezogen haben, ist es an der Zeit, auf diejenigen Probleme zurück- 
zukommen, aus denen die Einsteinsche Relativitätstheorie hervorgegangen 
ist, die Elektrodynamik und Optik bewegter Körper. Die Grundgesetze 
dieser Gebiete sind in den Maxwellschen Feldgleichungen zusammen- 
gefaßt, und schon Lorentz hatte erkannt, daß diese für den leeren Raum 
(e = I, (.L = ij = 0) bei den Lorentz-Transformationen invariant sind. 
Die exakten, invarianten Feldgleichungen für bewegte Körper hat Min- 
kowski (1907) aufgestellt; sie unterscheiden sich von den Lorentzschen 



214 ^^^ spezielle Einstemsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

Formeln der Elektronentheorie nur in nebensächlichen Gliedern, die nicht 
durch Beobachtungen geprüft werden können, haben aber mit diesen die 
partielle Mitführung der dielektrischen Polarisation gemein und erklären 
daher alle elektromagnetischen und optischen Vorgänge an bewegten 
Körpern in voller Übereinstimmung mit den Beobachtungen; wir erinnern 
insbesondere an die Versuche von Röntgen, Eichenwald und Wilson (V, ii, 
S. 146), doch wollen wir nicht darauf eingehen, weil dazu ausführliche 
mathematische Ableitungen nötig sind. Die Optik bewegter Körper aber 
läßt sich ganz elementar behandeln, und wir wollen sie als eine der 
schönsten Anwendungen der Einsteinschen Theorie hier darstellen. 

In dieser gibt es keinen Äther, sondern nur relativ zueinander be- 
wegte Körper. Daß alle optischen Vorgänge, bei denen Lichtquelle, 
durchstrahlte Substanzen und Beobachter in ein und demselben Inertial- 
systeme ruhen, dieselben sind für alle Inertialsyteme, ist nach der Einstein- 
schen Relativitätstheorie selbstverständlich; diese erklärt also auch den 
Michelsonschen Versuch, aus dem sie ja hervorgegangen ist. Es handelt 
sich also jetzt nur darum, ob die bei relativen Bewegungen von Licht- 
quelle, durchstrahltem Medium und Beobachter auftretenden Erscheinungen 
von der Theorie richtig wiedergegeben werden. 

Wir denken uns eine Lichtwelle in einem materiellen Körper, der 

c 
im Bezugsysteme S ruht; ihre Geschwindigkeit sei c^ = — (n ist der 

n 

Brechungsindex), ihre Schwingungszahl sei v^ ihre Richtung relativ zum 
System *S fest gegeben. Wir fragen, wie diese drei Merkmale der Welle 
von einem Beobachter beurteilt werden, der in einem Bezugsystem .S* 
ruht, das sich mit der Geschwindigkeit v parallel der :^-Richtung des 
Systems »S bewegt. 

Wir behandeln diese Frage nach derselben Methode, die wir früher 
(IV, 7, S. 94) darauf angewandt haben, nur daß wir statt der Galilei- 
Transformationen die Lorentz -Transformationen zugrunde legen. Wir 
haben dort gezeigt, daß die Wellenzahl 



'('-t) 



eine Invariante ist; denn sie bedeutet die Anzahl der Wellen, die vom 
Momente / = o an den Nullpunkt verlassen und bis zum Momente / den 
Punkt P erreichen, wobei sie um die Strecke s fortschreiten (Abb. 69, 
S. 93). Diese Invarianz gilt natürlich jetzt für Lorentz-Transformationen. 
Wir betrachten nun zunächst Wellen, die parallel zur .;c-Richtung fort- 
schreiten; dann ist für s die ;c-Koordinate des Punktes P zu setzen, und 
man hat 



('-ä-4-a 



WO r, V und c^^ c\ die Frequenzen und Geschwindigkeiten der Welle

wo a = Vi — i5'= \ I ä ist. Setzt man hier erst x=^ \^ / = o, 

dann / = i , ^ = o so erhält man :

Dividiert man die zweite Gleichung durch die erste, so erhält man:

löst man umgekehrt nach c\ auf, so erhält man die strenge Mitführungs- 
formel: 

c, — V

Diese stimmt genau mit dem Einsteinschen Additionstheorem der 
Geschwindigkeiten bei longitudinaler Bewegung [erste Formel (77), S. 198]; 
überein, wenn man darin up durch ^j, ti'p durch c\ ersetzt. Dieselbe 
Regel, die für die Umrechnung der Geschwindigkeiten materieller Körper 
relativ zu verschiedenen Bezugsystemen gilt, ist also auch auf die Licht- 
geschwindigkeit anwendbar. 

Dieses Gesetz ist aber, wenn man Glieder von höherer als 2. Ord- 

nung m /j = — vernachlässigt, mit der Fresnelschen Mitführungsformel 
(43), S. 106 identisch. Denn mit dieser Annäherung kann man schreiben:

und wenn man wieder das letzte Glied 2. Ordnung fortläßt und — ^ = — 

c n 

setzt:

Das ist genau die Fresnelsche Mitführungsformel. 

Die zweite der Formeln (95) stellt das Dopplersche Prinzip dar; 
dieses wendet man gewöhnlich auf das Vakuum an, setzt also Cj_ = c^ 
dann folgt aus dem Additionstheorem der Geschwindigkeiten bekanntlich 
(S. 198) auch c'^ = c. Sodann gibt die zweite der Formeln (95)

Die strenge Formel für den Doppler sehen Effekt bekommt also die

die die Gleichwertigkeit der Bezugsysteme S und S' in Evidenz setzt. 
Vernachlässigt man nun Glieder von höherer als 2. Ordnung, so ist

daher

in vollständiger Übereinstimmung mit der Formel (40), (S. 97). 

Um mit derselben Methode die Aberration des Lichtes abzuleiten, 
müssen wir einen Wellenzug betrachten, der sich senkrecht zur Bewegungs- 
richtung X der Systeme S und S' gegeneinander fortpflanzt; dabei müssen 
wir aber hinzufügen, ob die senkrechte Richtung bezüglich S oder S ge- 
meint ist, denn wenn der Strahl relativ zu S senkrecht auf der :*:-Achse

ist, ist er es nicht relativ zu S'. Wir wollen annehmen, die Fortpflanzungs- 
richtung sei die ^'- Achse des Systems S'] dann ist / = y' zu setzen und 
es gilt für das Vakuum (c^ = c^' = c): 



'('-7) = '-('-9 



Setzt man hier die durch die Lorentz-Transformation (72), S. 180, 
gegebenen Werte ein, so erhält man:

sodann für t = o:

Wäre die Wellenebene relativ zum Bezugsysteme S senkrecht zur 
y-Achse, so wäre s = y\ da das nicht der Fall ist, muß sie abgelenkt 
sein (Abb. 124). x, y sind die Koor- 
dinaten irgendeines Punktes P der 
Wellenebene. Wählen wir für F ins- 
besondere den Schnittpunkt A mit der 
:t:-Achse, so ist x = a, y = o zw 
setzen, also s = ß a\ ebenso ist für 
den Schnittpunkt B der Wellenebene 
mit der y- Achse x ^= o^ y =^ b zu 
setzen, also s = ab. 



Daher erhält man 



s ■= ß a = ab oder — =

Dieses Verhältnis — ist offenbar ein Maß für die Ablenkung der Wellen- 
front. Man sieht leicht, daß es mit der elementaren Definition der Aber- 
rationskonstante nach der Emissionstheorie {IV, 3, S. 74) übereinstimmt. 
Denn das vom Nullpunkt auf die Wellenebene gefällte Lot OC ist die 
Fortpflanzungsrichtung; ist Z> die Projektion von Cauf die :^- Achse, so ist. 
OB = d die Verschiebung, die man einem zur ^y-Achse parallelen Fern- 
rohr von der Länge D C =^ l während der vom Licht zum Durchlaufen 
des Rohres gebrauchten Zeit erteilen muß, damit ein bei C die Mitte

des Objektivs treffender Lichtstrahl gerade bei O die Mitte des Okulars

erreicht. Also ist — die Aberrationskonstante. Aus der Ähnlichkeit der 

Dreiecke O CD und B OA ergibt sich aber die Proportion 

l ~ a~ a "" j/i _ ^«* 

Das ist die exakte Aberrationsformel. Vernachlässigt man ^^ neben i, 
so geht sie in die elementare Formel 

d V 

T = '* = T 

Über. 

Dieses Resultat ist besonders bemerkenswert, weil sämtliche Äther- 
theorien bei der Erklärung der Aberration beträchtliche Schwierigkeiten 
zu überwinden haben. Mit Hilfe der Galilei-Transformation erhält man 
gar keine Ablenkung der Wellenebene und Wellenrichtung (IV, lo, S. 109), 
und man muß, um die Aberration zu erklären, den Begriff des > Strahles* 
einführen, der in bewegten Systemen nicht mit der Fortpflanzungsrichtung 
übereinzustimmen braucht. In der Einsteinschen Theorie ist das nicht 
nötig; in jedem Inertialsysteme S fällt die Richtung des Strahles, d. h. 
des Energietransportes, mit der Senkrechten auf den Wellenebenen zu- 
sammen, trotzdem ergibt sich die Aberration in derselben einfachen Weise 
wie der Dopplersche Efifekt und die Fresnelsche Mitführungszahl aus dem 
Begriffe der Welle mit Hilfe der Lorentz-Transformation. 

Diese Ableitung der Grundgesetze der Optik bewegter Körper zeigt 
die Überlegenheit der Einsteinschen Relativitätstheorie gegenüber allen 
anderen Theorien auf das schlagendste. 

10. Minkowskis absolute Welt. 

Das Wesen der neuen Kinematik besteht in der Untrennbarkeit von 
Raum und Zeit. Die Welt ist eine vierdimensionale Mannigfaltigkeit, ihr 
Element ist der Weltpunkt; Raum und Zeit sind Formen der Anordnung der 
Weltpunkte, und diese Ordnung ist bis zu gewissem Grade mit Willkür be- 
haftet. Minkowski hat diese Anschauung in die Worte gefaßt: »Von Stund 
an sollen Raum und Zeit für sich völlig zu Schatten herabsinken und nur 
noch eine Art Union der beiden soll Selbständigkeit bewahren.« Und 
er hat diesen Gedanken konsequent durchgeführt, indem er die Kinematik 
als vierdimensionale Geometrie entwickelte. Wir haben uns seiner Dar- 
stellung durchweg bedient, wobei wir nur zur Vereinfachung die y- und 
2-Achsen fortließen und in der :x: /-Ebene operierten. Werfen wir nun 
noch einen Blick vom mathematischen Standpunkte auf die Geometrie 
in der x /-Ebene, so erkennen wir, daß es sich nicht um die gewöhnliche 
Euklidische Geometrie handelt. Denn bei dieser sind alle vom Null- 



Minkowskis absolute Welt. 



219 




Abb. 125. 



punkt ausgehenden Geraden gleichberechtigt, die Längeneinheit auf ihnen 
ist dieselbe, die Eichkurve also ein Kreis (Abb. 125). In der xt-Ehene 
aber sind die raumartigen und zeitartigen Geraden nicht gleichwertig, 
auf jeder gilt eine andere Längeneinheit, die Eichkurve besteht aus den 
Hyperbeln 

G = x^— ^V' = ± I. 

In der Euklidischen Ebene kann man unendlich viele rechtwinklige 
Koordinatensysteme mit demselben Nullpunkte O konstruieren, die durch 
Drehung auseinander hervorgehen. In der a: /-Ebene gibt es ebenfalls un- 
endlich viele gleichberechtigte Koor- 
dinatensysteme, bei denen die eine 
Achse innerhalb eines VVinkelgebietes 
willkürlich gewählt werden kann. 

In der Euklidischen Geometrie ist 
die Entfernung ^ eines Punktes F mit 
den Koordinaten x^y vom Nullpunkte 
eine Invariante gegenüber den Dre- 
hungen des Koordinatensystems [s. III, 
7, Formel (28), S. 59]; nach dem 
Pythagoräischen Lehrsatze (Abb. 125) 
ist nämlich im A:>'-System 

s = X -}-y , 

und in irgendeinem .Vv'-System gilt ebenso s* ^^ x" -\-y'^. Die Eich- 
kurve, der Kreis mit dem Radius i, ist durch s = i dargestellt; daher 
wird man j, oder auch 5', als Grundinvariante der Euklidischen Geome- 
trie ansehen. 

In der jjc /-Ebene ist die Grundinvariante 

G = x'' — c''t% 
die Eichkurve ist 6^ = =h i. 

Minkowski bemerkte nun, daß hier eine Parallelität zum Vorschein 
kommt, die auf die mathematische Struktur der vierdimensionalen Welt 
(bzw. der ^ /-Ebene) ein helles Licht wirft. Setzt man nämlich — ^^/^ = w', 
so wird offenbar 

G=- x^'\-u^ = s"" 

und läßt sich als Grundinvariante 5" einer Euklidischen Geometrie mit 
den rechtwinkligen Koordinaten x^ u auffassen. 

Allerdings kann man aus der negativen Größe — c^t^ nicht die 
Quadratwurzel ziehen, u selbst läßt sich nicht aus der Zeit / berechnen. 
Aber die Mathematik ist längst gewohnt, solche Schwierigkeiten mit 
kühnem Schwünge zu überwinden. Die »imaginäre« Größe V — i =/ 
hat seit Gauß Bürgerrecht im mathematischen Reiche. Wir können hier 
auf die strenge Begründung der Lehre von den imaginären Zahlen nicht 
eingehen; sie sind im Grunde nicht »imaginärer«, als eine gebrochene 



2 20 D^s spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

Zahl wie f, denn Zahlen, »mit denen man zählt«, sind doch eigentlich 
nur die natürlichen, ganzen Zahlen i, 2, 3, 4 ... . 2 läßt sich nicht 
durch 3 teilen; | ist also ebensogut eine nicht ausführbare Operation 
wie V — I . Die Brüche wie | bedeuten eine Erweiterung des natür- 
lichen Zahlbegriffs, die durch die Schule und die Gewohnheit jedem 
geläufig und unanstößig ist. Eine ähnliche Erweiterung des Zahlbegriflfs 
sind die imaginären Zahlen, jedem Mathematiker ebenso gewohnt und 
geläufig, wie die Bruchrechnung. Alle Formeln, die imaginäre Zahlen 
enthalten, besitzen eine ebenso scharfe Bedeutung, wie die aus gewöhn- 
lichen, »reellen« Zahlen gebildeten, und die aus ihnen gezogenen Folge- 
rungen sind ebenso zwingend. 

Bedienen wir uns hier des Symbols V — i = /, so können wir 
schreiben : 

u = zcf. 

Die nicht-euklidische Geometrie der :r /-Ebene ist also formal mit der 
euklidischen Geometrie in der ^^^-Ebene identisch, wobei nur reellen 
Zeiten / imaginäre u-Werte entsprechen. 

Dieser Satz ist nun für die mathematische Behandlung der Relativitäts- 
theorie von unschätzbarem Vorteile. Denn bei zahlreichen Operationen 
und Rechnungen kommt es nicht auf die Realität der betrachteten Größen 
an, sondern nur auf die zwischen ihnen bestehenden algebraischen Be- 
ziehungen, die für imaginäre Zahlen ebenso gelterf wie für reelle. Man 
kann daher die aus der euklidischen Geometrie bekannten Gesetze auf 
die vierdimensionale Welt übertragen. Minkowski ersetzt 

X y z ict 
durch 

X y z u 

und operiert dann mit diesen 4 Koordinaten in völlig symmetrischer 
Weise. Die Grundinvariante wird dann offenbar 

Die Sonderstellung der Zeit verschwindet dadurch aus allen Formeln, was 
die Bequemlichkeit und Übersichtlichkeit der Rechnungen sehr erhöht. 
Im Schlußresultat muß man dann wieder u durch ict ersetzen, wobei nur 
solche Gleichungen physikalischen Sinn behalten, die ausschließlich mit 
reellen Zahlen gebildet sind. 

Der Nichtmathematiker wird sich unter diesen Ausführungen nicht 
viel denken können; er wird vielleicht, empört über die von Minkowski 
selbst halb im Scherz formulierte »mystische Gleichung« 3« io^°cm = 
V — I sec, den Kritikern der Relativitätstheorie beipflichten, denen die 
Gleichwertigkeit der Zeit mit den räumlichen Dimensionen als reiner Un- 
sinn erscheint. 

Wir hoffen, daß unsere Darstellungsweise, bei der die formale Me- 
thode Minkowskis erst am Schlüsse erscheint, solchen Einwänden stand- 
halten kann. In der ::i?/-Ebenp ist doch offenbar die Zeit t mit der Längen- 



Minkowskis absolute Welt. 221 



dimension x keineswegs vertauschbar; die Lichtlinien J und tj scheiden 
als unüberwindbare Schranken die zeitartigen von den raumartigen Welt- 
linien. Minkowskis Transformation u =. ict ist also nur als mathe- 
matischer Kunstgriff zu werten, der gewisse formale Analogien zwischen 
den Raumkoordinaten und der Zeit ins rechte Licht setzt, ohne doch 
eine Verwechslung zwischen ihnen zuzulassen. 

Aber dieser Kunstgriff hat wichtige Erkenntnisse gebracht; ohne ihn 
wäre Einsteins allgemeine Relativitätstheorie nicht denkbar. Dabei kommt 
es auf die Analogie der Grundinvariante G mit dem Quadrat einer Ent- 
fernung an. Wir werden in Zukunft für die Größe 

(96) s = ^G = Vx^'-^-y'-i-z^-i-u^ = Vx^-i-y'-^-z^ — c^t" 

die Bezeichnung i^vierdimensionale Entfernung'^ gebrauchen, wobei wir 
uns bewußt bleiben müssen, daß das Wort in übertragenem Sinne ver- 
standen wird. 

Der eigentliche Sinn der Größe s ist nach unsern früheren Erörte- 
rungen über die Invariante G leicht zu verstehen. Beschränken wir uns 
auf die ^ /-Ebene, so wird 

s = y~G = |/^H^~^ = Vx' — ^"7^ 

Nun ist für jede raumartige Weltlinie G positiv, also s als Quadrat- 
wurzel aus einer positiven Zahl eine reelle Größe; man kann dann den 
Weltpunkt x, t mit dem Nullpunkte durch Wahl eines geeigneten Bezug- 
systems S gleichzeitig machen. Dann ist / = o, also s = Vx' = x der 
räumliche Abstand des Weltpunktes vom Nullpunkte. 

Für jede zeitartige Weltlinie ist G negativ, also s imaginär; dann gibt 

es ein Koordinatensystem, in dem x = o, also s = V — c^t^ = ict ist. 
In jedem Falle hat also s eine einfache Bedeutung und ist als meßbare 
Größe zu betrachten. 

Wir schließen damit die Darstellung der speziellen Einsteinschen Re- 
lativitätstheorie ab. Ihr Ergebnis können wir etwa so zusammenfassen: 

Nicht nur die Gesetze der Mechanik^ sondern die aller Naturvorgänge^ 
besonders die elektromagnetischen Erscheinungen^ lauten vollkommen identisch 
in unendlich vielen^ relativ zueinander gleichförmig translatorisch be^vegten 
Bezugsystemen , die man Inertialsysteme nennt. In jedem dieser Systeme 
gilt ein besonderes Maß für Längen und Zeiten., und diese Maße sind durch 
die Lorentz- Transformationen miteinander verknüpft, 

Bezugsysteme, die sich relativ zu den Inertialsystemen beschleunigt be- 
wegen, sind, genau wie in der Mechanik, mit den Inertialsystemen nicht 
gleichwertig. Bezieht man die Naturgesetze auf solche beschleunigte Sy- 
steme, so lauten sie anders; in der Mechanik treten Fliehkräfte auf, in 
der Elektrodynamik analoge Wirkungen, deren Studium uns zu weit führen 
würde. Einsteins spezielle Relativitätstheorie beseitigt also nicht den 
Newtonschen absoluten Raum in dem eingeschränkten Sinne, den wir 



222 I^^s spezielle Einsteinsche Relativitätsprinzip. 

diesem Worte früher (III, 6, S. 55) gegeben haben; sie stellt gewisser- 
maßen nur für die ganze Physik einschließlich der Elektrodynamik den- 
jenigen Zustand her, den die Mechanik seit Newton hatte. Die tiefen 
Fragen des absoluten Raumes, die uns dort beunruhigten, sind also noch 
immer nicht gelöst: wir sind ihnen kaum einen Schritt näher gekommen, 
ja, durch die Erweiterung des physikalischen Gegenstandes über die Me- 
chanik hinaus ist die Aufgabe offenbar wesentlich erschwert. 
Wir werden jetzt sehen, wie Einstein sie bewältigt hat. 



VII. Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 




I. Relativität bei beliebigen Bewegungen. 

Bei der Erörterung der klassischen Mechanik haben wir ausführlich 
die Gründe besprochen, die Newton zur Aufstellung der Begrifife des 
absoluten Raumes und der absoluten Zeit geführt haben; wir haben aber 
auch sogleich die Einwände hervorgehoben, die man vom Standpunkte 
der Erkenntniskritik gegen diese Begriffsbildungen vorbringen kann. 

Newton stützt die Annahme des absoluten Raumes auf die Existenz 
der Trägh ei ts widerstände und Fliehkräfte. Diese können augenscheinlich 
nicht auf Wechselwirkungen von Körper zu Körper be- 
ruhen, weil sie im ganzen Universum, soweit die Be- 
obachtung reicht, unabhängig von der lokalen Verteilung 
der Massen in der gleichen Weise auftreten. Daher 
schließt Newton, daß sie von den absoluten Beschleuni- 
gungen abhängen. Damit wird der absolute Raum als 
fiktive Ursache physikalischer Erscheinungen eingeführt. 
Das Unbefriedigende dieser Theorie erkennt man aus 
folgendem Beispiele: 

Im Weltenraume mögen zwei flüssige Körper S^ und 
6*2 von gleicher Substanz und Größe vorhanden sein, in 
solcher Entfernung, daß die gewöhnlichen Gravitations- 
wirkungen des einen auf den anderen unmerklich gering 
sind (Abb. 126); jeder der Körper soll unter der Wir- 
kung der Gravitation seiner Teile aufeinander und der 
übrigen physikalischen Kräfte im Gleichgewicht sein, so 
daß keine relativen Bewegungen seiner Teile gegeneinander 
stattfinden. Aber die beiden Körper sollen um die Ver- 
bindungslinie ihrer Mittelpunkte eine relative Drehbewegung mit konstanter 
Rotationsgeschwindigkeit ausführen; das bedeutet, ein Beobachter auf dem 
einen Körper S^ stellt eine gleichförmige Drehung des andern Körpers 
•^2 g^g^n seinen eigenen Standpunkt fest, und umgekehrt. Nun soll 
jeder der Körper von relativ zu ihm ruhenden Beobachtern ausgemessen 
werden; es ergebe sich, daß S^ eine Kugel, S^ ein abgeplattetes Rotations- 
ellipsoid sei. 

Die Newtonsche Mechanik würde aus diesem verschiedenen Verhalten 
der beiden Körper den Schluß ziehen, daß S^ im absoluten Räume ruht, 



c::> 




Abb. 126. 



2 24 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

S^ aber eine absolute Rotation ausführt; die Fliehkräfte bewirken dann die 
Abplattung von S^. 

Man sieht an diesem Beispiele deutlich, daß der absolute Raum als 
(fiktive) Ursache eingeführt wird; denn S^ kann an der Abplattung von 
S^ nicht schuld sein, weil ja die beiden Körper relativ zueinander unter 
ganz gleichen Bedingungen stehen und daher sich gegenseitig nicht ver- 
schieden deformieren können. 

Der Raum als Ursache befriedigt aber das Kausalitätsbedürfnis nicht. 
Denn wir kennen keine andere Äußerung seiner Existenz als die Flieh- 
kräfte; man kann also die Hypothese des absoluten Raumes durch nichts 
anderes belegen als durch die Tatsachen, zu deren Erklärung sie ein- 
geführt ist. Eine gesunde Erkenntniskritik lehnt solche ad hoc gemachten 
Hypothesen ab; sie sind zu billig und zerbrechen alle Schranken, die ge- 
wissenhafte Forschung zwischen ihren Ergebnissen und den Hirngespinsten 
der Phantasie aufzurichten sucht. Wenn der Bogen Papier, den ich eben 
beschrieben habe, plötzlich vom Tische auffliegt, so stände mir die 
Hypothese frei, daß der Geist des längst verstorbenen Newton ihn ent- 
führt habe; aber als vernünftiger Mensch mache ich diese Hypothese 
nicht, sondern denke an die Zugluft, die entstand, weil das Fenster ofifen- 
steht und meine Frau gerade zur Tür hereintritt. Auch wenn ich die 
Zugluft nicht selbst gespürt habe, ist diese Hypothese vernünftig, weil 
sie den zu erklärenden Vorgang mit einem andern beobachtbaren Vor- 
gange in Verbindung bringt. Diese kritische Auswahl der zulässigen 
Ursachen unterscheidet die vernünftige, kausale Weltbetrachtung, zu der 
die physikalische Forschung gerechnet werden will, von Mystik, Spiritis- 
mus und ähnlichen Äußerungen ungebändigter Phantasie. 

Der absolute Raum aber hat nahezu spiritistischen Charakter. Fragt 
man: »was ist die Ursache der Fliehkräfte .N<, so lautet die Antwort: ^>der 
absolute Raum«. Fragt man aber: »was ist der absolute Raum und 
worin äußert er sich sonst?«, so weiß niemand eine andere Antwort als 
die: »der absolute Raum ist die Ursache der Fliehkräfte, sonst hat er 
keine Eigenschaften«. Diese Gegenüberstellung zeigt zur Genüge, daß 
der Raum als Ursache physikalischer Vorgänge aus dem Weltbilde be- 
seitigt werden muß. 

Vielleicht ist es nicht überflüssig anzumerken, daß die Heranziehung 
elektromagnetischer Erscheinungen an dieser Beurteilung des absoluten 
Raumes nichts ändert. Bei diesen treten in rotierenden Koordinaten- 
systemen Wirkungen auf, die den Fliehkräften der Mechanik analog sind ; 
aber das sind natürlich nicht neue, unabhängige Beweisgründe für die 
Existenz des absoluten Raumes, denn, wie wir wissen, sind durch den 
Satz von der Trägheit der Energie Mechanik und Elektrodynamik zu einer 
Einheit verschmolzen. Es ist nur für uns bequemer, allein mit den Be- 
griffen der Mechanik zu operieren. 

Kehren wir nun zur Betrachtung der beiden Körper 6", und S^ zurück. 



Das Äquivalenzprinzip. 225 



SO müssen wir, wenn der Raum als Ursache ihres verschiedenen Ver- 
haltens abgelehnt wird, nach anderen, reellen Ursachen suchen. 

Angenommen nun, es wären außerhalb der Körper »Sj und S^ absolut 
keine andern materiellen Körper vorhanden. Dann bliebe das ver- 
schiedene Verhalten von S^ und S^ tatsächlich unerklärbar. Aber ist 
denn dieses Verhalten empirische Tatsache: Zweifellos nicht; wir haben 
noch niemals Erfahrungen über zwei allein im Weltenraume schwebende 
Körper sammeln können. Die Annahme, daß zwei wirkliche Körper 5^ 
und S^ unter diesen Umständen sich verschieden verhielten, ist durch 
mc/its begründet. Man muß vielmehr verlangen, daß eine befriedigende 
Mechanik diese Annahme ausschließt. 

Wenn wir aber bei zwei wirklichen Körpern S^ und S^ das ge- 
schilderte verschiedene Verhalten beobachten (wir kennen ja mehr oder 
weniger abgeplattete Planeten), so dürfen wir als Ursache dafür rmi ferne 
Massen in Anspruch nehmen. In der wirklichen Welt sind solche ferne 
Massen tatsächlich vorhanden, das Heer der Gestirne. Welchen Welt- 
körper wir auch herausgreifen, so ist er umgeben von unzähligen anderen, 
die von ihm ungeheuer entfernt sind und sich relativ zueinander so lang- 
sam bewegen, daß sie als Ganzes etwa wie eine feste, hohle Masse 
wirken, in deren Hohlraum der betrachtete Körper sitzt. 

Diese fernen Massen müssen die Ursache der Fliehkräfte sein. Damit 
sind auch alle Erfahrungen im Einklänge; denn das Bezugsystem der 
Astronomie, gegen das die Rotationen der Himmelskörper bestimmt werden, 
ist so gewählt, daß es relativ zum Fixsternhimmel im Ganzen in Ruhe 
ist, genauer gesagt so, daß die scheinbaren Bewegungen der Fixsterne 
relativ zu dem Bezugsystem ganz ungeordnet sind und keine Vorzugs - 
richtung haben. Die Abplattung eines Planeten ist um so größer, je größer 
seine Drehgeschwindigkeit gegen dieses, mit den fernen Massen ver- 
bundene Bezugsystem ist. 

Demnach werden wir fordern, daß die Gesetze der Mechanik und die 
der Physik überhaupt nur die relativen Lagen und Bewegungen der Körper 
enthalten. Es darf kein Bezugsystem a priori bevorzugt sein, wie es die 
Inertialsysteme der Newtonschen Mechanik und der speziellen Einstein- 
schen Relativitätstheorie sind; denn sonst gingen in die Naturgesetze die 
absoluten Bechleunigungen gegen diese bevorzugten Bezugsysteme ein, 
nicht nur die relativen Bewegungen der Körper. 

Wir gelangen also zu dem Postulat, daß die wahren Gesetze der 
Physik in beliebig bewegten Bezugsystemen in gleicher Weise gelten 
sollen. Das ist eine beträchtliche Erweiterung des Relativitätsprinzips. 

2. Das Äquivalenzprinzip. 

Die Erfüllung dieses Postulats erfordert eine ganz neue Formulierung 
des Trägheitsgesetzes, da dieses der Grund für die Sonderstellung der 

Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. IJ- 



2 20 I^i^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

Inertialsysteme ist. Die Trägheit eines Körpers soll nicht mehr als Wir- 
kung des absoluten Raumes, sondern der andern Körper angesehen 
werden. 

Nun kennen wir nur eine Wechselwirkung zwischen allen materiellen 
Körpern, die Gravitation; ferner wissen wir, daß die Erfahrung einen 
merkwürdigen Zusammenhang zwischen Gravitation und Trägheit geliefert 
hat, den Satz von der Gleichheit der schweren und der trägen Masse 
(II, 12, S. 34). Die beiden, in der Newtonschen Formulierung so ver- 
schiedenen Phänomene der Trägheit und Attraktion werden also eine 
gemeinsame Wurzel haben. 

Das ist die große Entdeckung Einsteins, durch die das allgemeine 
Relativitätsprinzip aus einem Postulate der Erkenntniskritik in einen Satz 
der exakten Wissenschaften verwandelt worden ist. 

Wir können das Ziel der folgenden Untersuchung so kennzeichnen: 
in der gewöhnlichen Mechanik wird die Bewegung eines schweren Körpers 
(auf den keine elektromagnetischen oder anderen Kräfte wirken) durch 
zwei Ursachen bestimmt: i. seine Trägheit bei Beschleunigungen gegen 
den absoluten Raum, 2. die Gravitation der übrigen Massen. Jetzt soll 
eine Formulierung des Bewegungsgesetzes gefunden werden, bei dem 
Trägheit und Gravitation in einem höheren Begriffe verschmelzen, derart, 
daß die Bewegung allein durch die Verteilung der übrigen Massen in der 
Welt bestimmt ist. Bis zur Aufstellung des neuen Gesetzes müssen wir 
aber noch einen längeren Weg zurücklegen und einige begriffliche 
Schwierigkeiten überwinden. 

Wir haben den Satz von der Gleichheit der schweren und trägen 
Masse früher ausführlich besprochen. Für die irdischen Vorgänge besagt 
er: alle Körper fallen gleich schnell; für die Bewegungen der Himmels- 
körper drückt er aus, daß die Beschleunigung unabhängig ist von der 
Masse des bewegten Körpers. Wir haben auch- berichtet, daß der Satz 
nach Messungen von Eötvös mit außerordentlicher Genauigkeit gültig ist, 
daß er aber trotzdem in der klassischen Mechanik nicht zu den Grund- 
gesetzen gezählt, sondern als fast zufälliges Geschenk der Natur hin- 
genommen wird. 

Jetzt soll das anders werden; der Satz tritt an die Spitze nicht nur 
der Mechanik, sondern der ganzen Physik. 

Wir müssen ihn daher so beleuchten, daß sein fundamentaler Inhalt 
klar hervortritt. Wir raten dem Leser, folgendes einfache Experiment zu 
machen. Er nehme zwei leichte, aber verschieden schwere Gegenstände, 
etwa eine Münze und ein Stück Radiergummi, und lege sie auf den 
flachen Handteller. Er spürt dann das Gewicht der beiden Körper chen 
als Druck auf der Handfläche, und zwar ist dieser verschieden. Nun 
bewege er die Hand rasch nach unten; dann empfindet er eine Ver- 
ringerung des Druckes beider Körperchen. Wenn man diese Bewegung 
immer schneller wiederholt, so wird schließlich der Moment eintreten,

WO die Körperchen sich van der Handfläche lösen und hinter ihr während 
der Bewegung zurückbleiben; das tritt offenbar ein, sobald die Hand 
schneller herabsinkt, als die Körperchen frei herabfallen. Da diese nun 
trotz ihres verschiedenen Gewichtes gleich schnell fallen, so bleiben sie, 
auch nach der Ablösung von der Hand, immer in derselben Höhe bei- 
einander. 

Man denke sich nun Wichtelmännchen, die auf der Hand leben und 
nichts von der Außenwelt wissen ; wie würden diese den ganzen Vorgang 
beurteilen? Man kann sich leicht in die Seele solcher mitbewegter Be- 
obachter versetzen, während man den Versuch macht und auf die wechseln- 
den Drucke und Bewegungen der Körperchen gegen die Handfläche achtet. 
Bei ruhender Hand werden die Wichtelmännchen das verschiedene Ge- 
wicht der beiden Körperchen konstatieren. Wenn jetzt die Hand herab- 
sinkt, so werden sie eine Gewichtsabnahme der Körperchen feststellen; 
sie werden nach einer Ursache dafür suchen und bemerken, daß ihr Standort, 
die Hand, relativ zu den umgebenden Körpern, den Zimmerwänden^ herab- 
sinkt. Man kann nun aber die Wichtelmännchen mit den beiden Versuchs - 
körpern in einen geschlossenen Kasten sperren und diesen mit der Hand 
abwärts bewegen. Dann sehen die Beobachter im Kasten nichts, woran 
sie die Bewegung des Kastens feststellen könnten. Sie können dann einfach 
nur die Tatsache konstatieren, daß das Gewicht aller Körper im Kasten 
in gleicher Weise abnimmt. Wenn nun die Hand so schnell bewegt wird, 
daß die freifallenden Gegenstände hinter ihr zurückbleiben, so werden 
die Beobachter im Kasten zu ihrem Staunen die noch eben beträchtlich 
schweren Gegenstände nach oben fliegen sehen; sie bekommen negatives 
Gewicht, oder besser, die Schwerkraft wirkt nicht mehr nach unten, sondern 
nach oben. Auch fallen beide Körper trotz ihres verschiedenen Gewichts 
gleich schnell nach oben. Die Leute im Kasten können diese Beobach- 
tungen auf zweierlei Arten erklären: entweder denken sie, daß das Schwere- 
feld unverändert bestehen bleibt, der Kasten aber in der Richtung des 
Feldes beschleunigt wird; oder sie nehmen an, daß die anziehenden Massen 
unterhalb des Kastens verschwunden, dafür neue oberhalb des Kastens 
aufgetaucht sind, wodurch sich die Richtung der Schwerkraft umgekehrt 
hat. Wir fragen nun: Gibt es irgendein Mittel, um durch Experimente 
innerhalb des Kastens zwischen beiden Möglichkeiten zu unterscheiden? 

Und wir müssen antworten, daß die Physik ein solches Mittel nicht 
kennt. Tatsächlich ist die Wirkung der Schwere von der Wirkung der 
Beschleunigung durch nichts zu unterscheiden; beide sind einander völlig 
äquivalent. Das beruht wesentlich darauf, daß alle Körper gleich schnell 
fallen; wäre das nämlich nicht der Fall, so könnte man sogleich unter- 
scheiden, ob eine beschleunigte Bewegung verschieden schwerer Körper 
durch die Anziehung fremder Massen erzeugt oder nur durch Beschleunigung 
des Standpunktes des Beobachters vorgetäuscht wird. Denn in ersterem 
Falle bewegen sich verschieden schwere Körper verschieden schnell, in 

15* 



2 28 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

letzterem Falle aber ist die relative Beschleunigung aller frei beweglichen 
Körper gegen den Beobachter gleich groß, sie fallen trotz verschiedenen 
Gewichtes gleich schnell. 

Dieses Einsteinsche Äquivalenzprinzip gehört also zu jenen Sätzen, auf 
die wir in diesem Buche besonderes Gewicht gelegt haben, nämlich solchen, 
die die Nichtfeststellbarkeit einer physikalischen Aussage, die NichtUnter- 
scheidbarkeit zweier Begriffe behaupten. Die Physik lehnt solche Begrifife 
und Sätze ab und ersetzt sie durch neue; denn physikalische Realität 
haben nur feststellbare Tatsachen. 

Die klassische Mechanik unterscheidet zwischen der Bewegung eines sich 
selbst überlassenen, keinen Kräften unterworfenen Körpers, der Trägheits- 
bewegung, und der Bewegung eines Körpers unter der Wirkung der Gravi- 
tation. Die erste ist in einem Inertialsysteme geradlinig und gleichförmig; 
die zweite geht auf gekrümm-ten Bahnen und ungleichförmig vor sich. 
Nach dem Äquivalenzprinzip müssen wir diese Unterscheidung fallen lassen; 
denn man kann durch bloßen Übergang zu einem beschleunigten Bezug- 
systeme die gerade, gleichförmige Trägheitsbewegung in eine gekrümmte, 
beschleunigte Bewegung verwandeln, die von einer durch Gravitation er- 
zeugten nicht unterscheidbar ist, und auch das Umgekehrte gilt, wenigstens 
für beschränkte Stücke der Bewegung, wie nachher näher ausgeführt wird. 
Wir nennen von nun an jede Bewegung eines Körpers, auf den keine 
Kräfte elektrischen, magnetischen oder sonstigen Ursprungs wirken, sondern 
der nur unter dem Einfluß gravitierender Massen steht, eine Trägheits- 
bewegung', dieses Wort soll also eine allgemeinere Bedeutung haben wie 
früher. Der Satz, daß die Trägheitsbewegung relativ zu einem Inertial- 
systeme geradlinig gleichförmig ist, das gewöhnliche Trägheitsgesetz, hört 
jetzt natürlich auf. Vielmehr ist es gerade unser Problem: das Gesetz der 
Trägheitsbewegung in dem verallgemeinerten Sinne anzugeben. 

Die Lösung dieser Aufgabe befreit uns vom absoluten Räume und liefert 
zugleich eine Theorie der Gravitation, die dadurch viel tiefer mit den 
Prinzipien der Mechanik verknüpft wird, als in Newtons Lehre. 

Wir wollen diese Erörterungen noch etwas nach der quantitativen 
Seite ergänzen. Wir haben früher (III, 8, S. 62) gezeigt, daß die Be- 
wegimgsgleichungen der Mechanik bezogen auf ein System 5, das gegen 
die Inertialsysteme die konstante Beschleunigung k hat, in der Form 

mb^K' 
geschrieben werden können, wenn K' die Summe aus der wirklichen 
Kraft K und der Trägheitskraft — mk bedeutet: 

K' ^ K—mk. 
Ist nun die Kraft K die Schwere, so ist K = mg, also 

K' ^m{g — k). 
Indem man die Beschleunigung k des Bezugsystems S geeignet wählt, 
kann man der Differenz g — k jeden beliebigen positiven oder negativen 



Das Äquivalenzprinzip. 220 



Wert erteilen, sie auch zu Null machen. Nennt man in Analogie zur 
Elektrodynamik die Kraft auf die Masseneinheit die % Feldstärke {< der 
Schwere und den Raum, wo diese wirkt, das Schwerefeld , so kann man 
sagen: Durch geeignete Wahl des beschleunigten Bezugsystems kann man 
ein konstantes Schwerefeld schaffen, ein vorhandenes abschwächen, ver- 
nichten, verstärken, umkehren. 

Jedes beliebige Schwerefeld läßt sich offenbar innerhalb eines hin- 
reichend kleinen Raumteiles und während kurzer Zeit als annähernd 
konstant ansehen; daher kann man immer ein beschleunigtes Bezug- 
system finden, relativ zu dem in dem beschränkten Raum-Zeit- Gebiete 
kein Schwerefeld vorhanden ist. 

Man wird nun fragen, ob nicht jedes Gravitationsfeld in seiner ganzen 
Ausdehnung und für alle Zeiten durch bloße Wahl des Bezugsystems be- 
seitigt werden kann, ob sich also gewissermaßen alle Gravitation als 
»scheinbar« auffassen läßt. Das ist aber offenbar nicht der Fall. Das 
Feld der Erdkugel z. B. läßt sich nicht vollständig beseitigen. Denn es 
ist nach dem Zentrum gerichtet, die Beschleunigung müßte also von 
diesem fortweisen; das ist aber nicht möglich. Würde man selbst zu- 
lassen (und das werden wir müssen), daß das Bezugsystem nicht starr 
ist, sondern sich beschleunigt um den Erdmittelpunkt ausdehnt, so 
würde diese Bewegung nicht seit beliebig langer Zeit möglich sein, sie 
müßte einmal am Mittelpunkt angefangen haben. Durch Rotation des 
Bezugsystems um eine Achse erhält man eine von dieser fortgerichtete 
Trägheitskraft [III, 9, S. 64, Formel (31)], die Zentrifugalkraft 

47rV 
mk^ m -^^ • 

Diese kompensiert das Schwerefeld der Erde nur in einem gewissen Ab- 
stände r, nämlich dem Radius der als kreisförmig gedachten Mondbahn 
mit der Umlaufszeit T. 

Es gibt also »wahre« Gravitationsfelder, doch ist der Sinn dieses 
Wortes in der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie ein anderer, als in der 
klassischen Mechanik; denn man kann stets durch geeignete Wahl des 
Bezugsystems einen beliebigen, hinreichend kleinen Teil des Feldes be- 
seitigen. Wir werden erst später den Begriff des Gravitationsfeldes ge- 
nauer festlegen. 

Natürlich gibt es gewisse Gravitationsfelder, die in ihrer ganzen Aus- 
dehnung durch Wahl des Bezugsystems beseitigt werden können. Um 
solche zu finden, braucht man ja nur von einem Bezugsystem auszugehen, 
in dem ein Raumteil feldfirei ist, und ein irgendwie beschleunigtes Be- 
zugsystem einzuführen; relativ zu diesem besteht dann ein Gravitationsfeld. 
Dieses verschwindet, sobald man ziuii ursprünglichen Bezugsysteme zurück-

kehrt. Das Zentrifugalfeld k = -^2— ist von dieser Art. Die Frage, 



230 



Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 



wann sich ein Gravitationsfeld durch Wahl des Bezugsystems in seiner 
ganzen Ausdehnung ziun Verschwinden bringen läßt, kann natürlich erst 
von der fertigen Theorie beantwortet werden. 



3. Das Versagen der euklidischen Geometrie. 

Ehe wir aber fortschreiten, müssen wir eine Schwierigkeit überwinden, 
die beträchtliche Anstrengungen erfordert. 

Wir sind gewohnt, Bewegungen in der Minkowskischen Welt als 
Weltlinien darzustellen. Das Gerüst dieser vierdimensionalen Geometrie 
wurde durch die Weltlinien der Lichtstrahlen und die Bahnen der kräfte- 
frei bewegten, trägen Massen geliefert; diese Weltlinien sind in der alten 
Theorie relativ zu den Intertialsystemen gerade. Läßt man aber die 
allgemeine Relativität gelten, so sind beschleunigte Bezugsysteme gleich- 
berechtigt, in diesen sind die vorher geraden Weltiinien krumm (III, i, 
S. 44, Abb. 32). Dafür werden waeder andere Weltiinien gerade. Das 
gilt übrigens auch für die rämnlichen Bahnen. Die Begriffe gerade und 
krumm werden relativiert, sofern man sie auf die Bahnen der Licht- 
strahlen und frei beweglichen Körper bezieht. 

Damit kommt das ganze Gebäude der euklidischen Geometrie des 
Weltenraumes ins Wanken. Denn diese beruht (vgl. IH, i, S. 43) wesent- 
lich auf dem klassischen Trägheitsgesetze, das die geraden Linien festiegt. 

IVlan könnte nun denken, daß sich 
diese Schwierigkeit überwinden ließe, 
indem man zur Definition der geome- 
trischen Elemente wie Gerade, Ebene 
usw. nur starre Maßstäbe gebraucht. 
Aber auch das ist nicht möglich, wie 
Einstein folgendermaßen zeigt. 

Wir gehen von einem räumlichen 
Gebiete aus, in dem während einer 
gewissen Zeit relativ zu einem ge- 
eignet gewählten Bezugsystem S kein 
Gravitationsfeld existiert. 

Sodann betrachten wir einen Kör- 
per, der in diesem Gebiete mit kon- 
stanter Winkelgeschwindigkeit rotiert, etwa in Gestalt einer ebenen, auf 
der Rotationsachse senkrechten Kreisscheibe (Abb. 127); wfr fuhren 
ein mit dieser Scheibe fest verbundenes Bezugsystem S' ein. In S' 
herrscht dann ein nach außen gerichtetes Gravitationsfeld, gegeben durch 




Abb^i^T. 



die Zentrifugalbeschleunigung k = 



47c r 

rp-2. 



Nun will ein auf S befindlicher Beobachter die Kreisscheibe aus- 
messen. Dazu benutzt er einen Stab von bestimmter Länge als Einheit, 



Das Versagen der euklidischen Geometrie. 2 3 1 

der dabei relativ zu S' ruhen muß. Ein Beobachter in dem Bezugsysteme S 
benutzt genau denselben Stab als Längeneinheit, wobei dieser natürlich 
relativ zu S ruhen muß. 

Wir werden nun annehmen müssen, daß die Ergebnisse des spe- 
ziellen Relativitätsprinzips richtig bleiben, sofern wir uns auf Raumteile 
und Zeitabschnitte beschränken, in denen die Bewegung als gleichförmig 
angesehen werden kann. Damit das möglich ist, nehmen wir an, daß 
der Einheitsstab klein gegen den Scheibenradius ist. 

Legt nun der Beobachter in S' den Stab in der Richtung des 
Scheibenradius an, so wird der Beobachter in S feststellen, daß die Länge 
des bewegten Stabes relativ zu S unverändert gleich i ist; denn die 
Bewegung des Stabes ist senkrecht auf seiner Längsrichtung. Legt der 
Beobachter in S' den Stab aber an die Peripherie der Kreisscheibe an, 
so wird er dem Beobachter in S nach der speziellen Relativitätstheorie 
verkürzt erscheinen. Angenommen nun, man müßte 100 Stäbchen an- 
einanderlegen , um von einem Ende des Durchmessers der Scheibe zum 
andern zu kommen; dann würde der Beobachter in ,S /r = 3,14 . . . 
mal loo, d. h. etwa 314 seiner Stäbchen, die relativ in ^ ruhen, ge- 
brauchen, um die Peripherie auszumessen, aber der Beobachter in S' 
könnte mit dieser Stäbchenzahl nicht auskommen. Denn die in S' 
ruhenden Stäbchen erscheinen von S aus verkürzt, die Anzahl von 314 
genügt also nicht, um lückenlos die Peripherie zu umfassen. 

Demnach würde der Beobachter in S' behaupten, daß das Verhältnis 
des Kreisumfangs zum Durchmesser nicht 7t == 3,14 . • ., sondern größer 
sei. Das ist aber ein Widerspruch gegen die euklidische Geometrie. 

Ganz Entsprechendes gilt auch für die Messung der Zeiten. Bringt 
man von zwei gleich gebauten Uhren die eine in den Mittelpunkt, die 
andere an den Rand der Scheibe in relativer Ruhe zu dieser, so geht 
die letztere, vom System S beurteilt, langsamer, weil sie relativ zu S 
bewegt ist. 

Ein in der Mitte der Scheibe befindlicher Beobachter müßte oiGfenbar 
dasselbe konstatieren. Es ist also unmöglich, zu einer vernünftigen De- 
finition der Zeit mit Hilfe von relativ zum Bezugsysteme ruhenden Uhren 
zu kommen, wenn dieses Bezugsystem rotiert, beschleunigt ist, oder, was 
nach dem Äquivalenzprinzip dasselbe bedeutet, wenn in ihm ein Gravi- 
tationsfeld existiert. 

Im Gravitationsfeld ist ein Stab länger oder kürzer, geht eine Uhr 
schneller oder langsamer je nach der Stelle, wo das Meßgerät sich be- 
findet. 

Damit fällt aber die Grundlage der raumzeitlichen Welt, auf der bis- 
her alle unsere Überlegungen ruhten, in sich zusammen. Wir werden 
wieder zu einer Verallgemeinerung der Begriffe Raum und Zeit gedrängt, 
diesmal aber zu einer radikalen, die alle früheren an Gründlichkeit weit 
hinter sich läßt. 



21.2 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

Es ist offenbar sinnlos, in der gewöhnlichen Weise Koordinaten und 
Zeit Xj y, z, t zu definieren; denn dabei werden die geometrischen 
Grundbegriffe Gerade, Ebene, Kreis usw. als schlechthin gegeben an- 
gesehen, die Gültigkeit der euklidischen Geometrie im Räume bzw. der 
Minkowskischen Verallgemeinerung auf die raumzeitliche Welt wird vor- 
ausgesetzt. 

Daher entsteht die Aufgabe, die vierdimensionale Welt und ihre 
Gesetze darzustellen, ohne eine bestimmte Geometrie a priori zugrunde 
zu legen. 

Es scheint, als wenn jetzt der sichere Boden unter den Füßen ver- 
schwindet; alles schwankt, gerade ist krumm, krumm ist gerade. Aber die 
Schwierigkeit des Unternehmens hat Einstein nicht davon abgeschreckt. 
Wichtige Vorarbeiten hatte die Mathematik schon geleistet; Gauß (1827) 
hatte die Theorie der krummen Flächen in der Form einer allgemeinen 
zweidimensionalen Geometrie entworfen und Riemann (1854) hatte die 
Raumlehre von kontinuierlichen Mannigfaltigkeiten beliebig vieler Dimen- 
sionen begründet. Wir können hier diese mathematischen Hilfsmittel 
nicht benützen; ohne sie ist aber ein tieferes Verständnis der allgemeinen 
Relativitätstheorie nicht möglich. Der Leser darf darum von den folgen- 
den Ausführungen keine vollständige Aufklärung über Einsteins Lehren 
erwarten; er wird Bilder und Analogien finden, die immer ein schlechter 
Ersatz für exakte Begriffe sind. Aber wenn ihn diese Andeutungen zu 
tieferen Studien anregen, so ist ihr Zweck erfüllt. 

4. Die Geometrie auf krummen Flächen. 

Die Aufgabe, eine Geometrie ohne das a priori gegebene Gerüst 
der geraden Linien und ihrer euklidischen Verknüpfungsgesetze zu ent- 
werfen, ist keineswegs so ungewöhnlich, wie es zuerst scheinen mag. 
Wir denken uns, daß ein Feldmesser die Aufgabe hat, ein . hügeliges, 
ganz mit dichtem Walde bedecktes Terrain auszumessen und eine Karte 
davon zu entwerfen. Er kann von jeder Stelle aus nur eine ganz be- 
schränkte Umgebung übersehen; Visierinstrumente (Theodolithen) sind ihm 
nichts nütze, er ist im wesentlichen auf die Meßkette angewiesen. Mit 
dieser kann er kleine Dreiecke oder Vierecke ausmessen, deren Ecken 
durch Meßlatten fixiert sind, und durch Aneinanderfügen solcher direkt 
meßbaren Figuren kann er allmählich zu entfernteren Teilen des Geländes 
vordringen, die unmittelbar nicht sichtbar sind. 

Abstrakt ausgedrückt: der Feldmesser kann die Methoden der gewöhn- 
lichen euklidischen Geometrie auf kleine Gebiete anwenden. Das ganze 
Gelände ist aber diesen nicht zugänglich, sondern kann nur schrittweise, 
von Stelle zu Stelle fortschreitend, geometrisch erforscht werden. Ja, 
noch mehr: die euklidische Geometrie ist im hügeligen Gelände gar 
nicht streng gültig, es gibt darin überhaupt keine geraden Linien. Kurze 



Die Geometrie auf krummen Flächen. 



233 




Linienstücke von der Länge der Meßkette können als gerade angesehen 
werden; aber von Tal zu Tal, von Berg zu Berg führt keine gerade 
Verbindung auf dem Erdboden. Die euklidische Geometrie gilt also ge- 
wissermaßen nur im Kleinen, in infinitesimalen Bereichen; im Großen 
aber gilt eine allgemeinere Raum- oder besser Flächenlehre. 

Will der Feldmesser systematisch vorgehen, so wird er zunächst den 
Waldboden mit einem Netz von Linien bedecken, die durch Meßlatten 
oder markierte Bäume gekennzeichnet sind; er braucht zwei Scharen von 
Linien, die sich kreuzen (Abb. 128). 
Die Linien werden möglichst glatt, 
stetig gekrümmt gewählt und in jeder 
Schar durchlaufend numeriert; als Zei- 
chen für irgendeine Nummer der einen 
Schar wird der Buchstabe x genom- 
men, ebenso für die andere Schar j. 

Jeder Schnittpunkt hat dann zwei 
Nummern x^ y, etwa jc = 3 , j = 5 • 
Zwischenliegende Punkte lassen sich 
durch gebrochene Werte von x und 
y kennzeichnen. 

Dieses Verfahren, die Punkte einer krummen Fläche festzulegen, hat 
Gauß zuerst angewendet; man nennt x, y daher Gaußsche Koordinaten. 

Das wesentliche dabei ist, daß die Zahlen x und y nicht Längen, 
Winkel oder andere geometrische, meßbare Größen bedeuten, sondern 
nichts als Nummern^ geradeso, wie das System der amerikanischen 
Straßen- und Hausnummern. 

Das Maß in diese Bezifferung der Geländepunkte hineinzutragen, ist 
erst Sache des Feldmessers. Seine Meßkette umfaßt etwa den Bereich 
einer Masche des Netzes der Gaußschen Koordinaten. 

Der Feldmesser wird nun daran gehen, Masche für Masche auszu- 
messen; jede dieser kann als kleines Parallelogramm angesehen werden 
und ist durch Angabe zweier Seitenlängen und eines Winkels bestimmt. 
Diese muß der Feldmesser ausmessen und in die Karte für jede Masche 
eintragen. Ist das durchweg geschehen, so beherrscht er offenbar die 
Geometrie des Geländes vollständig mit Hilfe seiner Karte. 

An Stelle der 3 Daten pro Masche (2 Seiten und ein Winkel) pflegt 
man eine andere Methode der Maßbestimmung anzuwenden, die den Vor- 
zug größerer Symmetrie hat. 

Wir betrachten eine Netzmasche, ein Parallelogramm, dessen Seiten 
zwei aufeinanderfolgenden ganzen Nummern (etwa ^ = 3, ;c = 4 und 
ji; = 7j j^; z= 8) entsprechen (Abb. 129). Irgendein Punkt im Innern sei 
P\ sein Abstand von dem Eckpunkte O mit den kleineren Nummern 
sei s. Dieser wird mit der Meßkette ausgemessen. Durch P ziehen wir 
die Parallelen zu den Netzlinien, die diese in A und B treffen; ferner 



234 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

sei C der Fußpunkt der von F auf die :x; -Koordinatenlinie gefällten 
Senkrechten. 

Die Punkte A und B haben dann auch Nummern oder Gaußsche 
Koordinaten im Netze; man bestimmt A etwa dadurch, daß man die 
Parallelogrammseite, auf der A liegt, und die Strecke AO ausmißt, und 
das Verhältnis beider Längen als Zuwachs der :r-Koordinate von A gegen 
O nimmt. Wir wollen diesen Zuwachs selbst mit x bezeichnen, indem 
wir O als Nullpunkt der Gaußschen Koordinaten wählen. Ebenso be- 
stimmen wir die Gaußsche Ko- 
/ Ordinate y von JB als das Verhält - 

(/■8 I / nis, in dem B die entsprechende 

7 / Parallelogrammseite teilt, x^ y 

^f ~y^^^ / sind dann offenbar die Gaußschen 

/ .^^r / ' / Koordinaten von F. 

/ /^ / ' / Die wahre Länge von OA

U-3 X--^ dern etwa a • x, wo a eine be- 

Abb. 129. stimmte, durch die Messung zu 

ermittelnde Zahl ist; ebenso ist 
die wahre Länge von OB nicht y, sondern 3y. Wenn man den Punkt F 
herumbewegt, so ändern sich seine Gaußschen Koordinaten, aber die 
Zahlen a, b, welche das Verhältnis der Gaußschen Koordinaten zu den 
wahren Längen angeben, bleiben ungeändert. 

Wir drücken jetzt die Entfernung OF z= s mit Hilfe des rechtwink- 
ligen Dreiecks OFC nach dem Pythagoräischen Lehrsatze aus; es ist 

5"= OF' = 0C^-\- CF\ • 

Nun ist OC = OA^ AC, also 

s^ = 0A^-\- 2 OA- AC-^AC''-^- CF\ 

Andererseits ist in dem rechtwinkligen Dreiecke AFC: 

AC^-\- CF^ = AF^\ 
daher wird 

s^ = OA"" -\- 2 OA' AC-^ AF\ 

Hier ist OA = ax, AF= OB = dy; ferner ist AC die Projektion von 
AF = by, steht also in festem Verhältnisse dazu, etwa AC = cy. Daher 
erhalten wir: 

i"^ == a^x^ -\- 2 acxy -\- b'^y^. 

Hier sind a, b, c feste Verhältniszahlen ; man pflegt die 3 Faktoren dieser 
Gleichung anders zu bezeichnen, nämlich zu setzen 

(97) -y" = ^ii^^'+ ^g.^xy-\-g^-,y''' 

Diese Gleichung kann man den verallgemeinerten Fythagoräischen Lehr- 
salz für Gaußsche Koordinaten nennen. 



Die Geometrie auf krummen Flächen. 



235 



Die 3 Größen g^^, g^^^ g^^ können genau so, wie die Seiten und 
Winkel, zur Bestimmung der tatsächlichen Größenverhältnisse des Parallelo- 
gramms dienen. Man nennt sie daher die Faktoren der .Maßbestimmimg. 
Von Masche zu Masche haben sie andere Werte, die auf der Karte ein- 
getragen oder mit den Hilfsmitteln der analytischen Mathematik als 
»Funktionen« angegeben werden müssen. Sind sie aber für jede Masche 
bekannt, so ist damit durch die Formel (97) der wahre Abstand eines 
beliebigen Punktes F innerhalb einer beliebigen Masche vom Null- 
punkte der Masche berechenbar, wenn die Nummern oder Gaußschen 
Koordinaten x^y von F gegeben sind. 

Die Faktoren der Maßbestimmung repräsentieren also die gesamte 
Geometrie auf der Fläche. 

Man wird gegen diese Behauptung einwenden, daß das doch nicht 
stimmen kann; denn das Netz der Gaußschen Koordinaten war ganz will- 
kürlich gewählt, diese Willkür geht also in die g^^, g^^j ^22 ^^^- ^^^ ^^t 
allerdings richtig; man könnte ein anderes Netz wählen und würde dann 
für den Abstand derselben Punkte OF einen ebenso gebauten Aus- 
druck (97), aber mit anderen Faktoren ^11, ^'27 ^22 erhalten. Doch gibt 
es natürlich Regeln, um diese aus den g^j, g^^, g22 ^^ berechnen, Trans- 
formationsformeln von ähnlicher Art, wie wir sie früher kennen gelernt 
haben. 

Jede wirkliche geometrische Tatsache auf der Fläche muß nun offen- 



bar durch solche Formeln ausgedrückt werden können, die bei einem 
Wechsel der Gaußschen Koordinaten unverändert bleiben, invariant sind. 
Die Flächengeometrie wird damit eine Invariantentheorie sehr allgemeiner 
Art; denn die Linien des Koordinatennetzes sind völlig willkürlich, nur 
müssen sie so gewählt sein, daß sie stetig gekrümmt sind und die Fläche 
einfach und lückenlos überdecken. 

Welches sind nun die geometrischen Aufgaben, die der Feldmesser 
zu lösen haben wird, sobald er sich die Maßbestimmung verschafft hat? 

Auf der krummen Fläche gibt es keine geraden Linien, wohl aber 
geradeste Linien-, das sind zugleich diejenigen, die die kürzeste Ver- 
bindung zwischen zwei Punkten bilden. Ihr 
wissenschaftlicher Name ist »geodätische Linien«. f'^"^^^ 

Mathematisch sind sie dadurch charakterisiert: / ^ .^...^^ \

irgendeine andere Linie zwischen ihnen (Abb. 130). Die ^1,^2, • • lassen 
sich dabei rein rechnerisch aus dem verallgemeinerten Pythagoräischen 
Lehrsatze (97) bestimmen, wenn die g^j_, g^^j gz2 bekannt sind. 



2^6 ^i^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

Auf einer Kugelfläche sind bekanntlich die »größten Kugelkreise« die 
kürzesten Linien; sie werden durch die Ebenen ausgeschnitten, die durch 
den Mittelpunkt gehen. Auf andern Flächen sind es oft recht kompli- 
zierte Kurven ; und doch sind es die einfachsten Kurven, die das Gerüst 
der Geometrie auf der Fläche bilden, geradeso, wie die geraden Linien 
das Gerüst der euklidischen Geometrie der Ebene. 

Die geodätischen Linien werden natürlich durch invariante Formeln 
dargestellt; sie sind wirkliche geometrische Eigenschaften der Fläche. 
Aus diesen Invarianten lassen sich alle höheren ableiten; doch können 
wir darauf nicht eingehen. 

Eine andere fundamentale Eigenschaft der Fläche ist ihre Krümmung. 
Gewöhnlich definiert man diese mit Hilfe der dritten Raumdimension; die 
Krümmung einer Kugel mißt man z. B. mit Hilfe des Kugelradius, d. h. 
einer außerhalb der Kugelfläche liegenden Strecke. Unser Feldmesser 
im Waldgebirge wird dieses Mittel nicht anwenden können; er kann nicht 
aus seiner Fläche heraus und muß versuchen, die ELrümmungsverhältnisse 
nur mit seiner Meßkette zu ergründen. Daß das wirklich möglich ist, 
hat Gauß systematisch bewiesen. Wir können es uns durch folgende ein- 
fache Überlegung klar machen: 

Der Feldmesser mißt mit der Meßkette 12 gleichlange Seile ab und 
formt aus ihnen die nebenstehend abgebildete Sechseckfigur (Abb. 131). 

Nach einem bekannten Satze der gewöhnlichen 
Geometrie der Ebene ist es tatsächlich möglich, 
die 1 2 Seile in dieser Anordnung gleichzeitig in der 
Ebene gespannt zu halten; das ist eigentlich höchst 
wunderbar, denn wenn etwa 5 der 6 gleichseitigen 
Dreiecke fertig gespannt sind, so muß das letzte 
Seil von selbst in die Lücke passen. Man lernt 
Abb. 131. in der Schule, daß das geht, und was man in der 

Schule lernt, darüber pflegt man nachher nicht viel 
nachzudenken. Und doch ist es höchst erstaunlich, daß die Lücke ge- 
rade durch ein Seil von gleicher Länge wie die andern Seiten aus- 
gefüllt wird. 

Das geht auch tatsächlich nur in der Ebene; versucht man dasselbe 
auf einer krummen Fläche, derart, daß der Mittelpunkt und die 6 Eck- 
punkte auf dieser liegen, so schließt sich das Sechseck nicht; auf Berg- 
kuppen und in Talkesseln ist das letzte Seil zu lang, auf Pässen (sattel- 
förmig gekrümmten Flächenteilen) ist es zu kurz. 

Wir raten den Leser, das selbst einmal mit 12 Stücken Bindfaden 
auf einem Sophakissen zu probieren! 

Damit ist aber ein Kriterium gewonnen, wie man, ohne aus der 
Fläche herauszutreten , die Krümmung der Flächen finden kann. Geht 
die Sechseckfigur auf, so ist die Fläche eben; geht sie nicht auf, so ist 
die Fläche gekrümmt. Das Maß der Krümmung wollen wir nicht ab- 




Das zweidimensionale Kontlnuum. 237 

leiten; diese Andeutung genügt wohl, um plausibel zu machen, daß sich 
ein solches streng definieren läßt. Offenbar hängt es damit zusammen, 
wie sich die Faktoren der Maßbestimmung von Stelle zu Stelle ändern; 
das Krümmiingsmaß läßt sich, wie Gauß bewiesen hat, durch die 
S^.T.1 Sxii S-i-i ausdrücken und ist eine Invariante der Fläche. 

Die Gaußsche Flächentheorie ist eine Art, Geometrie zu treiben, die 
man mit einer der Physik entlehnten Ausdrucks weise als Nahwirkungs- 
theorie bezeichnen kann. Nicht die Gesetze der Fläche im Großen 
werden primär gegeben, sondern ihre differentiellen Eigenschaften, die 
Koeffizienten der Maßbestimmung und die daraus gebildeten Invarianten, 
vor allem das Krümmungsmaß; die Gestalt der Fläche und ihre geome- 
trischen Eigenschaften im Ganzen können dann nachträglich ermittelt 
werden, durch rechnerische Prozesse, die der Lösung der Differential- 
gleichungen der Physik sehr ähnlich sind. Die Geometrie Euklids ist im 
Gegensatz dazu eine typische Fernwirkungstheorie. Daran liegt es, daß 
die neuere Physik, die ganz auf den Begriffen der Nahwirkung, des Feldes, 
aufgebaut ist, mit dem euklidischen Schema nicht auskommt, sondern 
nach dem Vorbilde von Gauß neue Wege gehen muß. 

5. Das zweidimensionale Kontinuum. 

Stellen wir uns vor, daß unser Feldmesser mit dem Seil -Sechseck 
hantiert, um die Krümmung des Geländes festzustellen; dabei achtet er 
nicht darauf, daß in der Mitte des Sechsecks eine Lichtung im Walde 
ist, -durch die die Sonne die dort zusammenstoßenden Enden der Seile 
bestrahlt. Diese werden sich durch die Erwärmung etwas ausdehnen. 
Daher werden die 6 radialen Seile länger sein, als die 6 äußeren, und 
diese werden sich nicht schließen. Der Feldmesser wird daher, wenn 
das Gelände in Wirklichkeit eben ist, glauben, daß er auf einer flachen 
Bergkuppe (oder in einem Talkessel) sei. Ist er gewissenhaft, so wird 
er die Messung mit Seilen aus anderem Material wiederholen; diese 
werden sich in der Sonnenwärme mehr oder weniger ausdehnen als die 
zuvor gebrauchten, dadurch wird er auf den Fehler aufmerksam werden 
und ihn richtigstellen. 

Nim nehmen wir aber einmal an, daß die durch Erwärmung hervor- 
gerufene Längenänderung für alle verfügbaren Materialien, aus denen man 
Seile machen kann, gleich sei. Dann wird der Fehler niemals heraus- 
kommen. Ebenen werden für Berge, Berge für Ebenen gehalten werden. 
Oder stellen wir uns vor, daß irgendwelche, uns noch unbekannte Natur- 
kräfte auf die Längen von Stäben und Seilen Einfluß haben, aber auf 
alle in gleicher Weise. Dann würde die Geometrie, die der Feldmesser 
mit Meßkette und Seilpolygonen feststellt, ganz anders ausfallen, als die 
wirkliche Geometrie der Fläche; solange er aber immer nur in dieser 
hantiert und keine Möglichkeit hat, einen höheren Standpunkt einzu- 



2^8 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

nehmen, die dritte Dimension zu benutzen, so wird er fest überzeugt 
sein, daß er die richtige Geometrie der Fläche ergründet hat. 

Diese Überlegungen zeigen uns, daß der Begriff der Geometrie in 
einer Fläche oder, wie Gauß sagt, der »geometria intrinsica«, nichts zu 
tun hat mit der Gestalt der Fläche, wie sie einem Betrachter erscheint, 
der die dritte Raumdimension zur Verfügung hat. Ist einmal die Längen- 
einheit durch eine Meßkette oder einen Maßstab gegeben, so ist die 
Geometrie in der Fläche relativ zu dieser Maßbestimmung völlig fest- 
gelegt, mag auch der Maßstab in Wirklichkeit während des Messens alle 
möglichen Veränderungen erfahren. Für ein Wesen, das an die Fläche 
gebannt ist, sind diese Veränderungen nicht da, sobald sie alle Sub- 
stanzen in gleicher Weise betreffen. Daher wird dieses Wesen Krüm- 
mungen konstatieren, wo in Wirklichkeit keine sind, und umgekehrt. 
Dieses »in Wirklichkeit« wird aber sinnlos, wenn es sich um Flächen- 
wesen handelt, die überhaupt keine Vorstellung von einer dritten Dimen- 
sion haben; so, wie wir Menschen keine Vorstellung von einer vierten 
Raumdimension haben. Es ist dann für diese Wesen auch sinnlos, ihre 
Welt als »Fläche« zu bezeichnen, die in einem dreidimensionalen Räume 
eingebettet ist; vielmehr ist sie ein »zweidimensionales Kontinuum«. 
Dieses hat eine bestimmte Geometrie, bestimmte kürzeste oder geodätische 
Linien, auch ein bestimmtes »Krümmungsmaß« an jeder Stelle; aber die 
Flächenwesen werden keineswegs mit diesem Worte dieselbe Vorstellung 
verbinden, wie wir mit dem anschaulichen Begriffe der Krümmung einer 
Fläche, sondern sie werden damit nur die Tatsache meinen, daß das 
Seil -Sechseck sich mehr oder weniger schließt — nichts weiter. 

Gelingt es dem Leser, die Empfindungen dieses Flächenwesens nach- 
zuspüren und die Welt, wie sie ihm erscheint, sich vorzustellen, so ist 
er reif zu dem nächsten Schritte der Abstraktion. 

Es könnte doch uns Menschen in unserer dreidimensionalen Welt ge- 
nau so gehen. Vielleicht ist diese in einen vierdimensionalen Raum 
gerade so eingebettet, wie eine Fläche in unseren dreidimensionalen 
Raum; und durch uns unbekannte Kräfte werden in gewissen Raumteilen 
alle Längen verändert, ohne daß wir das direkt jemals merken können. 
Dann würde es aber möglich sein, daß in diesen Raumteilen ein nach 
Art der Sechseckfigur konstruiertes räumliches Polyeder sich nicht schließt, 
welches nach der gewöhnlichen Geometrie sich schließen müßte. 

Haben wir jemals etwas dergleichen beobachtet? Seit dem Altertum 
hat man immer die euklidische Geometrie für exakt richtig gehalten; ihre 
Sätze sind sogar von der kritischen Philosophie Kants (1781) als a priori 
richtig erklärt und gewissermaßen heilig gesprochen worden. Die großen 
Mathematiker und Physiker, vor allem Gauß, Riemann und Helmholtz, 
haben aber niemals diesen allgemeinen Glauben geteilt. Gauß selbst hat 
sogar einmal eine großartig angelegte Messung vorgenommen, um einen 
Satz der euklidischen Geometrie zu prüfen, nämlich den Satz, daß die

Winkelsumme im Dreieck zwei Rechte (180°) beträgt. Er hat das Drei- 
eck zwischen den drei Bergen Brocken, Hoher Hagen, Inselberg aus- 
gemessen; das Ergebnis war, daß die Winkelsumme innerhalb der Fehler- 
grenze den richtigen Betrag hat. 

Gauß ist wegen dieses Unternehmens von philosophischer Seite viel 
angefeindet worden; man sagte vor allem, selbst wenn er Abweichungen 
gefunden hätte, so wäre dadurch höchstens bewiesen, daß die Licht- 
strahlen zwischen den Fernrohren durch irgendwelche, vielleicht unbe- 
kannte, physikalische Ursachen abgelenkt seien, aber nichts über die 
Gültigkeit oder Ungültigkeit der euklidischen Geometrie. 

Einstein behauptet nun, wie wir schon oben (S. 230) gesagt haben, 
daß die Geometrie der wirklichen Welt tatsächlich nicht euklidisch ist 
und belegt diese Behauptung durch sehr konkrete Beispiele. Wir müssen 
nun, um das Verhältnis seiner Lehre zu den früheren Diskussionen über 
die Grundlagen der Geometrie zu verstehen, einige prinzipielle Über- 
legungen einschieben, die hart an das Philosophische streifen. 

6. Mathematik und W^irklichkeit. 

Es handelt sich um die Frage nach dem Gegenstande der geometri- 
schen Begriffe überhaupt. Der Ursprung der Geometrie ist sicherlich die 
praktische Kunst des Feldmessers, also eine rein empirische Lehre. Die 
Antike entdeckte, daß die geometrischen Sätze sich deduktiv beweisen 
lassen, d. h. daß man nur eine kleine Anzahl von Grundsätzen oder 
Axiomen anzunehmen braucht, um daraus rein logisch das ganze System 
der übrigen Sätze ableiten zu können. Diese Entdeckung hat eine ge- 
waltige Wirkung gehabt; denn die Geometrie wurde das Vorbild jeder 
deduktiven Wissenschaft, und etwas »more geometrico« zu demonstrieren, 
galt als Ziel des strengen Denkers. Was sind nun die Gegenstände, mit 
denen sich die wissenschaftliche Geometrie beschäftigt? Die Philosophen 
und Mathematiker haben diese Frage nach allen Richtungen diskutiert 
und eine große Zahl von Antworten gegeben. Allgemein zugestanden 
wurde die Sicherheit und unumstößliche Richtigkeit der geometrischen 
Sätze; das Problem war nur, wie man zu solchen absolut sicheren Sätzen 
kommt und auf was für Dinge sie sich beziehen. 

Zweifellos ist das: Wenn jemand die geometrischen Axiome als richtig 
zugibt, so ist er gezwungen, auch alle übrigen Sätze der Geometrie an- 
zuerkennen. Denn die Kette der Beweise ist für jeden zwingend, der 
überhaupt logisch denken kann. Damit ist die Frage auf die nach dem 
Ursprung der Axiome reduziert. In diesen hat man eine kleine Anzahl 
von Sätzen über Punkte, Gerade, Ebenen und ähnliche Begriffe vor sich, 
die ganz exakt gelten sollen. Daher können sie nicht, wie die meisten 
Aussagen der Wissenschaft und des täglichen Lebens, aus der Erfahrung 
stammen; diese liefert immer nur ungefähr richtige, mehr oder minder 



240 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

wahrscheinliche Sätze. Man muß daher nach anderen Erkenntnisquellen 
suchen, die eine absolute Sicherheit der Sätze verbürgen. Nach Kant 
(1781) sind Raum und Zeit Formen der Anschauung, die a priori sind, 
vor jeder Erfahrung vorhergehen und diese überhaupt erst möglich machen. 
Die Gegenstände der Geometrie müßten danach vorgebildete Formen der 
reinen Anschauung sein, die den Urteilen zugrunde liegen, welche wir 
in der empirischen Anschauung über wirkliche Gegenstände fällen. Da- 
nach käme etwa das Urteil: »diese Kante des Lineals ist gerade« da- 
durch zustande, daß die empirisch angeschaute Kante mit der reinen 
Anschauung einer Geraden verglichen wird, natürlich ohne daß dieser 
Prozeß zum Bewußts.^in kommt. Der Gegenstand der geometrischen 
Wissenschaft wäre dann die in der reinen Anschauung gegebene Gerade; 
also weder ein logischer Begriff, noch ein physisches Ding, sondern ein 
drittes, dessen Wesen nur durch Hinweis auf das mit der Anschauung 
»gerade« verbundene Erlebnis vermittelt werden kann. 

Wir wollen uns nicht anmaßen, über diese Lehre oder über ähnliche 
philosophische Theorien ein Urteil zu fällen. Sie betreffen vor allem 
das Raumerlebnis, und dieses liegt außerhalb des Gegenstandes unseres 
Buches. Hier handelt es sich uqi Raum und Zeit der Physik, also einer 
Wissenschaft, die sich bewußt und immer deutlicher von der Anschauung 
als Erkenntnisquelle abwendet und schärfere Kriterien verlangt. 

Da müssen wir nun feststellen, daß ein Physiker das Urteil »diese 
Kante des Lineals ist gerade« niemals auf die unmittelbare Anschauung 
des Geradeseins stützen wird. Es ist ihm ganz gleichgültig, ob es so 

etwas wie eine reine Form der An- 
schauung des Geraden gibt oder nicht 




^//////////fJ/fJ lJIulm^ gibt, mit dem die Linealkante ver- 

... etlichen werden kann. Er wird viel- 

Abb. 132. ° 

mehr bestimmte Versuche machen, um 
die Geradlinigkeit zu prüfen, geradeso 
wie er jede andere Behauptung über 
Gegenstände durch Versuche prüft. Er 
wird z. B. an der Linealkante entlang 




Abb. 133. visieren, d. h. feststellen, ob ein Licht- 

strahl, der Anfangs- und Endpunkt der 
Kante berührt, auch an allen übrigen Punkten der Kante gerade berührend 
entlang streicht (Abb. 132). Oder er wird das Lineal um die Endpunkte 
der Kante drehen und einen Stift mit einem beliebigen Zwischenpunkte 
der Kante in Berührung bringen; wenn bei der Drehung diese Berührung 
erhalten bleibt, ist die Kante gerade (Abb. 133). 

Unterwerfen wir nun diese Verfahren, die jedenfalls der Anschauung 
weit überlegen sind, der Kritik, so sehen wir, daß sie über die absolute 
Geradlinigkeit eigentlich auch nichts ausmachen. Bei der ersten Methode 
ist offenbar schon vorausgesetzt, daß der Lichtstrahl geradlinig sei; wie 



Mathematik und Wirklichkeit. 24 1 

beweist man, daß er das ist? Bei der zweiten Methode ist vorausgesetzt, 
daß die Drehpunkte des Lineals und die Spitze in starrer Verbindung stehen 
und daß das Lineal selbst starr ist; angenommen, man wolle die Gerad- 
linigkeit eines Stabes mit kreisförmigem Querschnitte prüfen, der horizontal 
gelagert ist und sich durch die eigene Schwere ein wenig durchbiegt, so 
wird diese Durchbiegung bei der Drehung unverändert bleiben, die Tast- 
methode wird also Geradlinigkeit erkennen, wo in Wirklichkeit Krüm- 
mung vorliegt. Man werfe nicht ein, daß das Fehlerquellen sind, die 
bei jeder physikalischen Messung vorkommen und vom geschickten Ex- 
perimentator vermieden werden. Worauf es uns ankommt, ist zu zeigen, 
daß absolute Geradlinigkeit oder sonst eine andere geometrische Eigen- 
schaft empirisch nicht direkt geprüft werden kann, sondern nur relativ 
zu bestimmten geometrischen Eigenschaften der bei der Messung ver- 
wendeten Hilfsmittel (Geradlinigkeit des Lichtstrahls, Starrheit der Ap- 
paratteile). Entkleidet man die wirklich ausgeführten Operationen aller 
Zutaten des Denkens, Erinnerns, Wissens, so bleibt nur übrig die Fest- 
stellung: Fallen 2 Punkte der Linealkante auf einen Lichtstrahl, so tut 
es auch dieser oder jener andere; fallen 2 Punkte des Lineals mit zwei 
Punkten eines Körpers zusammen, so gilt dasselbe auch für diesen oder 
jenen dritten Punkt. Wirklich festgestellt werden also räumliche oder 
besser raum-zeitliche Koinzidenzen^ d. h. das Zusammentreffen zweier mate- 
rieller, erkennbarer Punkte zur selben Zeit am selben Orte. Alles übrige 
ist Spekulation, selbst eine so einfache Behauptung, daß durch solche 
Koinzidenzversuche am Lineal dessen Geradlinigkeit festgestellt werden 
kann. 

Eine kritische Musterung der exakten Wissenschaften lehrt, daß alle 
Feststellungen überhaupt auf solche Koinzidenzen herauslaufen. Jede 
Messung ist am Ende die Konstatierung, daß ein Zeiger oder eine Marke 
mit dem und dem Teilstrich einer Skala zu der und der Zeit zusammen- 
trifft. Ob die Messung Längen, Zeiten, Kräfte, Massen, elektrische 
Ströme, chemische Affinitäten oder was auch immer betrifft, alles tat- 
sächlich Feststellbare sind raum-zeitliche Koinzidenzen. Das sind in der 
Sprache Minkowskis Weltpunkte, die durch Begegnung materieller Welt- 
linien in der Raum -Zeit -Mannigfaltigkeit markiert sind. Physik ist Lehre 
von den Beziehungen solcher markierter Weltpunkte. 

Die logische Verarbeitung dieser Beziehungen ist die mathematische 
Theorie; mag sie noch so verwickelt sein, ihr letzter Zweck ist immer, 
die tatsächlich beobachteten Koinzidenzen als denknotwendige Folgen 
einiger Grundbegriffe und Grundsätze darzustellen. Manche Aussagen 
über Koinzidenzen treten in der Form geometrischer Sätze auf; die Geo- 
metrie als eine auf die wirkliche Welt anwendbare Lehre hat dabei keine 
Sonderstellung vor andern Zweigen der physikalischen Wissenschaften. 
Ihre Begriffsbildungen sind in derselben Weise durch das tatsächliche 
Verhalten der natürlichen Gegenstände bedingt, wie die Begriffe anderer 

Born, Relativitätstheorie. 3. Aufl. 16 



242 I^i^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

physikalischer Gebiete. Irgendeine Vorzugsstellung können wir der Geo- 
metrie nicht zuerkennen. 

Daß die euklidische Geometrie bislang unumschränkt galt, beruht auf 
dem empirischen Faktum, daß es Lichtstrahlen gibt, die mit großer Ge- 
nauigkeit sich so verhalten, wie die Geraden des Begriffsschemas der 
euklidischen Geometrie, und daß es nahezu starre Körper gibt, die den 
euklidischen Axiomen der Kongruenz genügen. Der Behauptung von der 
absolut exakten Gültigkeit der Geometrie können wir vom physikalischen 
Standpunkte aus keinen faßbaren Sinn unterlegen. 

Die Gegenstände der tatsächlich auf die Welt der Dinge angewandten 
Geometrie sind also diese Dinge selbst, von einem bestimmten Gesichts- 
punkte aus betrachtet. Die gerade Linie ist durch Definition der Licht- 
strahl, oder die Trägheitsbahn, oder die Gesamtheit der Punkte eines 
als starr betrachteten Körpers, die bei einer Drehung um zwei feste 
Punkte sich nicht bewegen, oder sonst ein physisches Etwas. Ob die so 
definierte Gerade diejenigen Eigenschaften hat, die die Geometrie Euklids 
behauptet, ist dann nur auf Grund der Erfahrung feststellbar. Eine solche 
Eigenschaft der euklidischen Geometrie ist der Satz von der Winkelsumme 
im Dreieck, den Gauß empirisch geprüft hat; wir müssen die Berechti- 
gung solcher Versuche durchaus anerkennen. Eine andere charakteristische 
Eigenschaft der zweidimensionalen Geometrie war durch das Sichschließen 
des Seil- Sechsecks (S. 236) gegeben. Nur die Erfahrung kann lehren, ob 
eine bestimmte Art der Realisierung der Geraden, der Längeneinheit usw. 
durch bestimmte physische Dinge diese Eigenschaft hat oder nicht. Im 
ersteren Falle ist die euklidische Geometrie relativ zu diesen Definitionen 
anwendbar, im letzteren nicht. 

Einstein behauptet nun: alle bisher üblichen Definitionen der Grund- 
begriffe des räum -zeitlichen Kontinuums durch starre Maßstäbe, Uhren, 
Lichtstrahlen, Trägheitsbahnen genügen wohl in begrenzten, kleinen Ge- 
bieten den Gesetzen der euklidischen Geometrie bzw. der Minkowskischen 
Welt, im Großen aber nicht. Nur die Geringfügigkeit der Abweichungen 
ist daran schuld, daß man sie bisher nicht entdeckt hat. Man könnte 
nun zwei Wege zur Abhilfe einschlagen: Entweder man gibt es auf, 
die Gerade durch den Lichtstrahl, die Länge durch den starren Kör- 
per usw. zu definieren, und sucht andere Realisationen der euklidischen 
Grundbegriffe, um an dem euklidischen System ihrer logischen Zusammen- 
hänge festhalten zu können; oder man gibt die euklidische Geometrie 
selbst auf und sucht eine allgemeinere Raumlehre aufzustellen. 

Daß der erste Weg ernstlich nicht in Betracht kommt, leuchtet jedem 
ein, der nicht ganz fremd ist im Gebäude der Wissenschaft. Aber man 
kann auch nicht beweisen, daß er unmöglich ist. Hier entscheidet nicht 
die Logik, sondern der wissenschaftliche Takt. Es gibt keinen logischen 
Weg von den Tatsachen zur Theorie; der Einfall, die Intuition, die 
Phantasie sind hier, wie überall, die Quellen schöpferischer Leistung, und

das Kriterium der Richtigkeit ist die prophetische Voraussage noch un- 
erforschter oder zukünftiger Vorgänge. Der Leser mache einmal die 
Annahme: Der Lichtstrahl im leeren Weltenraume sei nicht das »ge- 
radeste«, was es gibt, und denke ihre Konsequenzen durch. Dann wird 
er verstehen, daß Einstein einen andern Weg einschlug. 

Er hätte, da die euklidische Geometrie versagte, eine bestimmte 
andere nichteuklidische wählen können. Es gibt solche ausgebaute Be- 
griffssysteme, von Lobatschewski (1829), Bolyai (1832), Riemann 
(1854), Helmholtz (1866) und anderen, die hauptsächlich ersonnen 
wurden, um zu prüfen, ob bestimmte Axiome Euklids denknotwendige 
Folgen der übrigen sind; wären sie das, so müßte man zu logischen 
Widersprüchen kommen, wenn man sie durch andere Axiome ersetzt. 
Wollte man eine solche spezielle nichteuklidische Geometrie zur Dar- 
stellung der physikalischen Welt wählen, so hieße das den Teufel durch 
Beelzebub austreiben. Einstein ging auf das physikalische Urphänomen, 
die raumzeitliche Koinzidenz, das Ereignis, den Weltpunkt, zurück. 

7. Die Maßbestimmung des raumzeitlichen Kontinuums. 

Die Gesamtheit der markierten Weltpunkte ist das tatsächlich Fest- 
stellbare. Das vierdimensionale raumzeitliche Kontinuum ist an und für 
sich strukturlos; erst die tatsächlichen Beziehungen der Weltpunkte in 
ihm, die das Experiment aufdeckt, drücken ihm eine Maßbestimmung 
und Geometrie auf. Wir haben also in der wirklichen Welt dieselben 
Umstände vor uns, die wir eben bei der Betrachtung der Flächengeo- 
metrie kennen gelernt haben. Die Methode der mathematischen Be- 
handlung wird daher auch dieselbe sein. 

Zunächst wird man Gaußsche Koordinaten in der vierdimensionalen 
Welt einführen. Wie konstruieren ein Netzwerk markierter Weltpunkte; 
das bedeutet, wir denken uns den Ratun erfüllt durch beliebig bewegte 
Materie, die sich drehen und deformieren mag, aber ihren stetigen Zu- 
sammenhang immer wahren soll, eine Art »Molluske«, wie Einstein sich 
ausdrückt; darin ziehen wir 3 Scharen von sich durchkreuzenden Linien, 
die wir numerieren und durch die Buchstaben x, 7, z unterscheiden. In 
den Ecken des entstehenden Maschennetzes denken wir uns Uhren an- 
gebracht, von ganz beliebigem Gange, nur so, daß der Unterschied der 
Angaben / örtlich benachbarter Uhren klein ist. Das Ganze ist also ein 
unstarres Bezugsystem, eine »Bezugsmolluske«. In der vierdimensionalen 
Welt entspricht ihr ein System Gaußscher Koordinaten, bestehend aus 
einem Netz von 4 numerierten Flächenscharen x, y, z, t. 

Alle bewegten, starren Bezugsysteme sind natürlich spezielle Arten 
dieser sich deformierenden Bezugsysteme. Es ist aber von unserm all- 
gemeinen Standpunkte aus sinnlos, die Starrheit als etwas a priori Ge- 
gebenes einzuführen. Auch die Trennung von Raum und Zeit ist gänz- 

16* 



244 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

lieh willkürlich; denn da der Gang der Uhren völlig willkürlich, nur 
stetig veränderlich, angenommen werden kann, so ist der Raum als Ge- 
samtheit aller »gleichzeitigen« Weltpunkte keine physikalische Realität. 
Bei anderer Wahl der Gaußschen Koordinaten werden andere Weltpunkte 
gleichzeitig. 

Was sich aber nicht ändert beim Übergang von einem System Gauß- 
scher Koordinaten zu einem andern, das sind die Schnittpunkte von 
reellen Weltlinien, die markierten Weltpunkte, raumzeitliche Koinzidenzen. 
Alle wirklich feststellbaren Tatsachen der Physik sind qualitative Lagen - 
beziehungen dieser Weltpunkte, bleiben also bei einem Wechsel der 
Gaußschen Koordinaten unberührt. 

Eine solche Transformation der Gaußschen Koordinaten des raum- 
zeitlichen Kontinuums bedeutet den Übergang von einem Bezugsystem 
zu einem beliebig deformierten und bewegten. Die Forderung, nur wirk- 
lich Feststellbares in die Gesetze der Natur aufzunehmen, führt also 
dazu, daß diese gegen beliebige Transformationen der Gaußschen Koor- 
dinaten Xy j, s, / in andere x\ y\ z, / invariant sein sollen. Dieses 
Postulat enthält ofifenbar das allgemeine Relativitätsprinzip in sich, denn 
unter allen Transformationen von x, y, z, t sind auch die, welche den 
Übergang von einem dreidimensionalen Bezugsysteme zu einem beliebig 
bewegten darstellen; aber es geht formal noch darüber hinaus, indem 
es beliebige Deformationen des Raumes und der Zeit einschließt. 

Damit haben wir die Grundlage der allgemeinen Raumlehre gefunden, 
auf der allein die Durchführung der vollständigen Relativität möglich ist. 
Es wird sich jetzt darum handeln, diese mathematische Methode mit den 
physikalischen Überlegungen zu verknüpfen, die wir früher angestellt 
haben und die in der Aufstellung des Äquivalenzprinzipes gipfelten. 

Wir sind jetzt bezüglich der vierdimensionalen Welt in derselben 
Lage wie der Feldmesser im Waldgebirge, nachdem er sein Koordinaten- 
netz abgesteckt, aber noch nicht begonnen hat, es mit der Meßkette 
auszumessen. Wir müssen uns nach einer vierdimensionalen Meßkette 
umsehen. 

Dafür ist nun das Äquivalenzprinzip gut. Wir wissen: Durch geeignete 
Wahl des Bezugsystems kann man immer erreichen, daß in einem hin- 
reichend kleinen Weltgebiete kein Gravitationsfeld herrscht. Es gibt un- 
endlich viele solche Bezugsysteme, die sich geradlinig und gleichförmig 
relativ zueinander bewegen und für die die Gesetze der speziellen Re- 
lativitätstheorie gelten. Maßstäbe und Uhren verhalten sich so, wie die 
Lorentz -Transformationen ausdrücken; Lichtstrahlen und Trägheitsbe- 
wegungen (s. S. 228) sind gerade Weltlinien. Innerhalb dieses kleinen 
Weltgebietes ist also die Größe 

u- = s = X -\- y -j-s — et 

eine Invariante von unmittelbarer physikalischer Bedeutung. Ist nämlich 



Die Maßbestimmung des raumzeitlichen Kontinuums. 



245 



die Verbindung des Nullpunkts O (der im Innern des kleinen Gebietes 
angenommen ist) mit dem Weltpunkte P (xy z t) eine raumartige Welt- 
linie, so ist s die Entfernung OP in demjenigen Bezugsystem, in dem 
die beiden Punkte gleichzeitig sind; ist aber die Weltlinie OP zeit- 
artig, so ist s = zcf, wo / die Zeitdifferenz der Ereignisse O und P in 
dem Koordinatensystem ist, in dem beide am selben Ort stattfinden. 
Wir haben s früher (VI, 10, S. 221) die vierdimensionale Entfernung ge- 
nannt; sie ist direkt mit Maßstäben und Uhren meßbar, sodann hat sie 
bei Einführung der imaginären Koordinate ii = ict formal den Charakter 
einer euklidischen Entfernung im vierdimensionalen Räume: 



Die Tatsache der Gültigkeit der speziellen Relativitätstheorie im 
Kleinen entspricht genau der Anwendbarkeit der euklidischen Geometrie 
auf hinreichend kleine Stücke einer krummen Fläche. Genau wie dort 
braucht aber im Großen die euklidische Geometrie bzw. die spezielle 
Relativitätstheorie nicht zu gelten; es braucht überhaupt keine geraden 
Weltlinien zu geben, nur geradeste oder geodätische Linien. 




Die weitere Behandlung der vierdimensionalen Welt geht der Flächen- 
theorie parallel. Zunächst muß man die Maschen eines beliebigen Netzes 
Gaußscher Koordinaten mit Hilfe der vierdimensionalen Entfernung s aus- 
messen. Wir deuten das Verfahren in einer zweidimensionalen :x: /-Ebene 
an (Abb. 134). Eine Masche des Koordinatennetzes werde durch die 
Linien ^ == 3, x = äf und / = 7, / = 8 begrenzt (vgl. Abb. 129 auf 
S. 234). Die von dem Eckpunkte x =^ 2>i ^ = 7 ausgehenden Licht- 
strahlen entsprechen zwei sich kreuzenden Weltlinien, die wir innerhalb 
eines kleinen Gebietes als Gerade zeichnen können, die sich unter 90° 
schneiden. Zwischen diesen Lichtlinien verlaufen die hyperbolischen Eich- 
kiirven 6^ = dz i ; sie entsprechen dem Kreise, welcher in der ge- 
wöhnlichen Geometrie die Punkte gleicher Entfernung i enthält. 



246 I^is allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

Dann ergibt die Übertragung der Formel (97) aus der Flächentheorie 
für die Invariante s den Ausdruck: 

WO X und u = ict die Gaußschen Koordinaten irgendeines Punktes P 
der betrachteten Masche sind. 

Setzt man nun ii = ict ein, so wird 

S^ == g^^Oc'' -\- 2icg^^Xt— C^'g^J^ 

oder mit anderer Bezeichnung der Faktoren: 

gii) gl 2) ^22 heißen Faktoren der Maßbestimmung und lassen sich 
direkt physikalisch interpretieren. So ist z. B. für / = o s = Vg^ j x, 
d. h. y^jj bedeutetet die wahre Länge der räumlichen Maschenseite in 
dem Bezugsystem, in welchem sie ruht. 

In der vierdimensionalen Welt wird die invariante Entfernung s zweier 
Punkte, deren relative Gaußsche Koordinaten x^ y, z, t sind, durch 
einen Ausdruck der Form 

(98) S^ = ^„ ^^ _|-^. ^;;^ +^3^S^ +^^^ t^ 

+ 2gz2^y-\- 2g,^XZ-}- 2g^^Xt 

■i- 2g^^yz -i-2g^^yt -\- 2g^^zt 

dargestellt werden; man kann diese Formel den verallgemeinerten Pytha- 
goräischen Lehrsatz ßir die vierdimensionale Welt nennen. 

Die Größen g^^^ • -^34 sind die Faktoren der Maßbestimmung \ sie 
werden im allgemeinen von Masche zu Masche des Koordinatennetzes 
verschiedene Werte haben. Auch werden sie für eine andere Wahl der 
Gaußschen Koordinaten andere Werte haben, die durch bestim^mte Trans - 
formationsformeln mit den ursprünglichen verbunden sind. 

8. Die Grundgesetze der neuen Mechanik. 

Nach dem allgemeinen Relativitätsprinzip e werden die Naturgesetze 
durch Invarianten bei beliebiger Transformation der Gaußschen Koor- 
dinaten dargestellt, genau so, wie die geometrischen Eigenschaften einer 
Fläche bei beliebigen Transformationen der krummlinigen Koordinaten in- 
variant sind. Das Gerüst der Flächentheorie waren die geodätischen 
Linien. Ganz ebenso werden wir in der vierdimensionalen Welt geo- 
dätische Linien konstruieren, d. h. solche WeltHnien, die die kürzeste 
Verbindung zwischen zwei Weltpunkten bilden; dabei ist die Entfernung 
zweier benachbarter Punkte durch die Invariante s zu messen. 

Was bedeuten nun die geodätischen Linien? Offenbar sind sie in 
solchen Gebieten, die bei geeigneter Wahl des Bezugsystems frei von 
Gravitation sind, bezüglich dieses Systems gerade Linien; die geraden 



Die Grundgesetze der neuen Mechanik. 247 

Weltlinien sind aber entweder raumartig (s^ ^ o) oder zeitartig (s^ <^ o) 
oder Lichtlinien (^ = o). Führt man ein anderes System Gaußscher 
Koordinaten ein, so werden dieselben Weltlinien jetzt krumm, bleiben 
aber natürlich geodätische Linien. 

Daraus geht hervor, daß die geodätischen Linien gerade diejenigen 
physikalischen Vorgänge darstellen müssen, die in der gewöhnlichen Geo- 
metrie und Mechanik durch gerade Linien dargestellt werden: die Licht- 
strahlen und Trägheitsbewegungen. Damit haben wir die gesuchte For- 
mulierung für das verallgemeinerte Trägheitsgesetz gefunden, das die Er- 
scheinungen der Trägheit und Gravitation in einem Ausdrucke zusammenfaßt. 

Sind die Faktoren der Maßbestimmung g^^^ , . .g^^ relativ zu einem 
beliebigen Gaußschen Koordinatensystem für jede Stelle des Netzes be- 
kannt, so lassen sich die geodätischen Linien rein rechnerisch finden. 
Wenn in einem Bereiche relativ zu dem betrachteten Koordinatensystem 
kein Gravitationsfeld vorhanden ist, so sind 

(99) ^11 = <r22 = «Tss = ^> ^44 = — ^') 

«^12 <5i3 öl 4 023 624 034 ^> 

denn dann reduziert sich der allgemeine Ausdruck der Entfernung (98) 
auf s"^ = x^ -\- y"" -\- z"^ — c'^t^, Abweichungen der g von diesen Werten 
bedeuten also jenen Zustand, den man in der gewöhnlichen Mechanik 
als Gravitationsfeld bezeichnet; die Trägheitsbewegungen sind dann un- 
gleichförmig und gekrümmt, wofür die gewöhnliche Mechanik die New- 
tonsche Anziehungskraft als Ursache angibt. Die 10 Größen g haben 
also eine doppelte Funktion: i. Sie definieren die Maßbestimmung, die 
Einheiten der Längen und Zeiten; 2. sie vertreten das Gravitationsfeld 
der gewöhnlichen Mechanik. Man sagt: die g bestimmen das metrische 
Feld oder Gravitationsfeld. 

Die Einsteinsche Theorie ist also eine höchst wunderbare Verschmel- 
zung von Geometrie und Physik, eine Synthese der Gesetze des Pytha- 
goras und des Newton. Sie erreicht das durch eine gründliche Reini- 
gung der Begriffe Raum und Zeit von allen Zutaten der subjektiven 
Anschauung, durch die vollständigste Objektivierung und Relativierung, 
die denkbar ist. Darin beruht die Bedeutung der neuen Lehre für die 
geistige Entwicklung der Menschheit. 

Die neue Formulierung des Trägheitsgesetzes ist aber nur der erste 
Schritt der Theorie. Wir haben die g begriflflich eingeführt und in ihnen 
das Mittel kennen gelernt, den geometrisch -mechanischen Zustand der 
Welt relativ zu einem beliebigen Gaußschen Koordinatensystem mathe- 
matisch zu beschreiben. Jetzt kömmt das eigentliche Problem der Theorie 
zum Vorschein: 

Es sollen die Gesetze gefunden werden, nach denen das metrische 
Feld (die g) für jede Stelle des raumzeitlichen Kontinuums relativ zu 
irgendeinem Gaußschen Koordinatensystem bestimmt werden kann. 



248 I^ic allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

Über die Gesetze wissen wir vorläufig folgendes: 

1. Sie müssen invariant sein gegenüber beliebigem Wechsel der 
Gaußschen Koordinaten; 

2. sie müssen durch die Verteilung der materiellen Körper vollständig 
bestimmt sein. 

Hierzu kommt noch eine formale Bedingung, die Einstein aus der 
gewöhnlichen Newtonschen Gravitationstheorie übernommen hat; stellt 
man nämlich diese als Pseudo-Nahwirkungstheorie durch Differentialglei- 
chungen dar, so sind diese, wie alle Feldgesetze der Physik, von der 
zweiten Ordnung, und man wird verlangen, daß die neuen Gravitations- 
gesetze, welche Differentialgleichungen für die g sind, ebenfalls höchstens 
von zweiter Ordnung sein sollen. 

Es ist Einstein gelungen, die Gleichungen des metrischen Feldes oder 
Gravitationsfeldes aus diesen Forderungen abzuleiten. Hilbert, Klein, 
Weyl und andere Mathematiker haben dabei mitgewirkt und die formale 
Struktur ^der Einsteinschen Formeln tief durchforscht und aufgehellt. 
Wir müssen darauf verzichten, diese Gesetze und ihre Begründung mit- 
zuteilen, weil das ohne Anwendung höherer Mathematik nicht möglich ist. 
Einige Andeutungen müssen hier genügen. 

Wir wissen aus der Flächentheorie, daß die Krümmung eine Invariante 
gegenüber beliebigem Wechsel der Gaußschen Koordinaten ist, die sich 
durch Messungen in der Fläche selbst bestimmen läßt; der Leser er- 
innere sich an das Seil- Sechseck. 

In ganz analoger Weise lassen sich für die vierdimensionale Welt 
Invarianten finden, die direkte Verallgemeinerungen der Krümmungs- 
invariante der Flächentheorie sind. Man denke sie sich etwa so ent- 
standen: Von einem Punkte F der vierdimensionalen Welt lasse man alle 
geodätischen Weltlinien ausgehen, die eine durch den Punkt F gehende 
zweidimensionale Fläche berühren ; diese geodätischen Linien erfüllen selbst 
wieder eine Fläche, die man geodätische Fläche nennen könnte. Wenn 
man nun in diese ein Sechseck hineinlegt, dessen Seiten und Radien die 
gleiche vierdimensionale Länge haben, so wird sich dieses Sechseck im all- 
gemeinen nicht schließen; die geodätische Fläche ist also gekrümmt. Wenn 
man die geodätische Fläche durch den Punkt F anders im vierdimensio- 
nalen Räume orientiert, ändert sich die Krümmung. Die Gesamtheit der 
Krümmungen aller geodätischen Flächen durch einen Punkt liefert eine An- 
zahl unabhängiger Invarianten. Wenn diese Null sind, so sind die geo- 
dätischen Flächen eben, der vierdimensionale Raum ist euklidisch. Die Ab- 
weichungen der Invarianten von Null bestimmen also die Gravitationsfelder 
und müssen von der Verteilung der materiellen Körper abhängen. Die 
Masse eines Körpers aber ist nach der speziellen Relativitätstheorie 
[VI. 8, Formel (94), S. 209] gleich der Energie, dividiert durch das Quadrat 
der Lichtgeschwindigkeit; die Verteilung der Materie wird daher von ge- 
wissen Energie -Impuls -Invarianten bestimmt. Diese sind es, denen die 



Mechanische Folgerungen und Bestätigungen. 2dQ 

Krümmungsin Varianten proportional gesetzt werden. Der Proportionali- 
tätsfaktor entspricht der Gravitationskonstante (III, 3, S. 50) der Newton- 
schen Theorie. Die so gewonnenen Formeln sind die Gleichungen des 
metrischen Feldes. Ist die raumzeitliche Verteilung der Energie und des 
Impulses gegeben, so lassen sich daraus die g berechnen, und diese 
bestimmen wiederum die Bewegung der materiellen Körper und die Ver- 
teilung ihrer Energie. Das Ganze ist ein höchst verwickeltes System 
von Differentialgleichungen; aber diese mathematische Komplikation wird 
aufgewogen durch den ungehexuren, begrifflichen Fortschritt, der in ihrer 
allgemeinen Invarianz besteht. Denn diese ist der Ausdruck der voll- 
ständigen Relativität aller Vorgänge; der absolute Raum ist endgültig aus 
den Gesetzen der Physik verschwunden. 

Wir müssen hier noch einer Bezeichnungsweise Erwähnung tun, die 
bei Nichtmathematikern gewöhnlich Anstoß erregt. Man pflegt die ztir 
Flächenkrümmung analogen Invarianten des dreidimensionalen Raumes 
oder der vierdimensionalen Welt selbst als Krümmungsmaß zu bezeichnen ; 
man sagt von raumzeitlichen Gebieten, wo dieses von Null verschieden 
ist, sie seien »gekrümmt«. Hiergegen empört sich gewöhnlich das Ge- 
müt des Ungelehrten: »daß etwas im Räume gekrümmt sei, kann ich 
mir vorstellen, aber daß der Raum gekrümmt sein soll, das ist doch 
barer Unsinn!« Nun, es verlangt auch niemand, daß man sich das vor- 
stellen soll; kann man sich unsichtbares Licht vorstellen, oder unhörbare 
Töne: Wenn man zugibt, daß hier die Sinne versagen und die Me- 
thoden der Physik weiter reichen, so muß man sich entschließen, für die 
Lehre vom Räume und von der Zeit dasselbe zuzugestehen. Denn die 
Anschauung erblickt nur das, was durch das Zusammenwirken von physi- 
kalischen, physiologischen und psychischen Vorgängen als geistiger Prozeß 
zustande kommt und dadurch tatsächlich gegeben ist; die Physik leugnet 
nicht, daß dieses tatsächlich Gegebene gewiß mit größter Schärfe nach 
den klassischen Gesetzen Euklids interpretiert werden kann. Die Ab- 
weichungen, die die Einsteinsche Theorie vorhersagt, sind so winzig, daß 
nur die außerordentliche Meßgenauigkeit der heutigen Physik und Astro- 
nomie sie offenbaren kann. Darum sind sie aber doch da, und wenn 
die Summe der Erfahrungen zu dem Resultat führt, daß das raumzeitliche 
Kontinuum nichteuklidisch oder »gekrümmt« ist, so muß die Anschauung 
dem Urteile der Erkenntnis weichen. 

9. Mechanische Folgerungen und Bestätigungen. 

Die erste Aufgabe der neuen Physik ist zu zeigen, daß die klassische 
Mechanik und Physik mit großer Annäherung richtig ist; denn sonst wäre 
nicht zu verstehen, daß zwei Jahrhunderte unermüdlicher und sorgfältiger 
Forschung sich mit ihr begnügen konnten. Das nächste Problem ist 
dann, Abweichungen ausfindig zu machen, die für die neue Theorie 
charakteristisch sind und zu ihrer Prüfung an der Erfahrung dienen können. 



250 I^ic allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

Warum reicht die klassische Mechanik zur Darstellung aller irdischen 
und fast aller kosmischen Bewegungsvorgänge aus? Was tritt an die 
Stelle der Begriffe vom absoluten Räume und von der absoluten Zeit, 
ohne die nach den Newtonschen Prinzipien schon die einfachsten Tat- 
sachen, wie das Verhalten des Foucaultschen Pendels, die Trägheits- und 
Fliehkräfte u. dgl. nicht erklärt werden können? 

Wir haben diese Fragen im Grunde schon zu Beginn der Erörterungen 
über das allgemeine Relativitätsprinzip beantwortet ; wir haben dort (VII, i , 
S. 225) als das Fundament der relativistischen Dynamik den Satz aufgestellt 
daß an die Stelle des absoluten Raumes als fiktiver Ursache von physikali- 
schen Vorgängen jetzt ferne Massen als wirkliche Ursachen zu treten 
haben. Der Kosmos als ganzer, das Heer der Gestirne, erzeugt an jeder 
Stelle und zu jeder Zeit ein bestimmtes metrisches Feld oder Gravitations- 
feld; wie dieses im Großen beschaffen ist, kann nur eine Spekulation 
kosmologischer Art lehren, wie wir sie nachher kennen lernen werden 
(VII, II, S. 260). Im Kleinen aber muß bei geeigneter Wahl des Bezug- 
systems das metrische Feld »euklidisch« sein, d. h. die Trägheitsbahnen 
und Lichtstrahlen gerade Weltlinien. Gegenüber dem Kosmos sind nun 
selbst die Dimensionen unseres Planetensystems klein, und darum gelten 
darin, bezogen auf ein geeignetes Koordinatensystem, die Newtonschen 
Gesetze, soweit nicht die Sonne oder die planetarischen Massen lokale 
Störungen hervorrufen, die den Anziehungen der Newtonschen Theorie 
entsprechen. Die Astronomie lehrt, daß ein solches Bezugsystem, in 
dem die Wirkung der Fixsternmassen innerhalb des Bereiches unseres 
Planetensystems zur euklidischen Maßbestimmung führt, gerade in rela- 
tiver Ruhe (oder in gleichförmiger und geradliniger Bewegung) zu der 
Gesamtheit der kosmischen Massen ist, daß also die Fixsterne gegen 
dieses System nur relativ kleine, im Mittel sich aufhebende Bewe- 
gungen machen; eine Erklärung dieser astronomischen Tatsache läßt 
sich nur durch eine Anwendung der neuen dynamischen Prinzipien auf 
den ganzen Kosmos geben, die uns im Schlußabschnitt beschäftigen wird. 
Hier haben wir es zunächst mit der Mechanik und Physik innerhalb des 
Planetensystems zu tun. Dann bleiben alle Lehren der Newtonschen Me- 
chanik fast unverändert bestehen ; nur muß man immer daran denken, daß die 
Schwingungsebene des Foucaultschen Pendels nicht gegen den absoluten 
Raum, sondern gegen das System der fernen Massen feststeht, daß die 
Fliehkräfte nicht bei absoluten Rotationen, sondern bei Rotationen gegen 
die fernen Massen auftreten. Ferner ist es durchaus unbenommen, die 
Gesetze der Physik nicht auf das gewohnte Koordinatensystem zu beziehen, 
in dem das metrische Feld euklidisch ist und ein Gravitationsfeld im 
gewöhnlichen Sinne (bis auf die lokalen Felder der planetaren Massen) 
nicht existiert, sondern auf ein irgendwie bewegtes (oder sogar ein sich 
deformierendes) System; nur treten in diesem Falle sogleich Gravitations- 
felder auf und die Geometrie verliert ihren euklidischen Charakter. Die 



Mechanische Folgerungen und Bestätigungen. 25 1 

allgemeine Form aller Naturgesetze bleibt immer dieselbe; nur sind die 
Werte der Größen g^^^ g^^, . . . g^^, die das metrische Feld oder Gravita- 
tionsfeld bestimmen, in jedem Bezugsystem andere. In dieser Invarianz der 
Gesetze allein liegt der Unterschied gegen die alte Dynamik; dort konnte 
man natürlich auch zu beliebig bewegten (oder deformierten) Bezugsystemen 
übergehen, aber die Naturgesetze behielten dabei nicht ihre Gestalt, es 
gab »einfachste« Formen der Naturgesetze, die in bestimmten, im abso- 
luten Räume ruhenden Koordinatensystemen angenommen wurden. In 
der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie gibt es keine solchen einfachsten, aus- 
gezeichneten Formen der Gesetze; höchstens können die Zahlenwerte der 
in allen Naturgesetzen vorkommenden Größen g^^, • • -^34 innerhalb be- 
grenzter Räume besonders einfach sein oder sich von solchen einfachen 
Werten nur wenig entfernen. So bezieht die Astronomie ihre Formeln 
auf ein Bezugsystem, das innerhalb des kleinen Raumes des Planeten- 
systems, wenn es keine Sonne und keine Planeten gäbe, euklidisch wäre, 
wo also die g^^, ... g die einfachen Werte (99), S. 247, hätten; in Wahr- 
heit haben die g^^, . . .g^^ aber gar nicht diese Werte, sondern weichen 
in der Nähe der planetaren Massen davon ab, wie wir nachher näher 
erläutern werden. Irgendein anderes (etwa rotierendes) Bezugsystem, in 
dem die g^^, •••^34 ^^ch ohne planetare Massen nicht die einfachen 
Werte (99) haben, ist daher prinzipiell mit dem ersten völlig gleich- 
berechtigt. Damit ist die Rückkehr zu des Ptolemäus Standpunkt der 
»ruhenden Erde« ins Belieben gestellt; es würde das die Benutzung eines 
mit der Erde fest verbundenen Bezugsystems bedeuten, wobei die g^^, 
• ••^34 solche Werte bekommen, die dem Zentrifugalfeld der Rotation 
gegen die fernen Massen entsprechen. Von Einsteins hoher Warte ge- 
sehen haben Ptolemäus und Kopernikus gleiches Recht: beide Standpunkte 
liefern dieselben Natiurgesetze, nur mit verschiedenen Zahlenwerten der 
St.x) •••^34- Welchen Standpunkt man wählt, ist nicht aus Prinzipien 
entscheidbar, sondern Sache der Bequemlichkeit. Für die Mechanik des 
Planetensystems ist allerdings die Auffassung des Kopernikus die bequemere. 
Aber es ist sinnlos, die bei anderer Wahl des Bezugsystems auftretenden 
Gravitationsfelder als »fiktiv« in Gegensatz zu den »wirklichen«, von den 
nahen Massen erzeugten, zu bezeichnen; genau so sinnlos, wie in der 
speziellen Relativitätstheorie die Frage nach der »wirklichen« Länge eines 
Stabes (VI, 5, S. 192). Ein Gravitationsfeld ist an sich weder »real« noch 
»fiktiv«; es hat überhaupt keine von der Koordinatenwahl unabhängige 
Bedeutung, genau wie die Länge eines Stabes. Auch unterscheiden sich 
die Felder keineswegs dadurch, daß die einen von Massen erzeugt werden, 
die andern nicht; nur sind es in einem Falle hauptsächlich die nahen 
Massen, im andern allein die fernen Massen des Kosmos. 

Gegen diese Lehre hat man Argumente des »gesunden Menschen- 
verstandes« vorgebracht, unter andern folgendes. Wenn ein Eisenbahn- 
zug auf ein Hindernis stößt und dadurch im Zuge alles in Trümmer 



2C2 Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

geht, SO kann man den Vorgang auf zwei Weisen beschreiben: Einmal 
kann man die Erde (die hier als relativ zu den kosmischen Massen ruhend 
betrachtet wird) als Bezugsystem wählen und die (negative) Beschleunigung 
des Zuges für die Zerstörung verantwortlich machen; man kann aber 
auch ein mit dem Zuge fest verbundenes Koordinatensystem wählen, 
dann macht im AugenbHck des Zusammenstoßes relativ zu diesem System 
die ganze Welt einen Ruck und es tritt überall ein parallel der ursprüng- 
lichen Bewegung gerichtetes, sehr starkes Gravitationsfeld, auf, welches 
die Zerstörungen im Zuge verursacht. Warum fällt dann der Kirchturm 
im benachbarten Dorfe nicht ebenfalls um? Warum machen sich die 
Folgen des Rucks und des damit verbundenen Gravitationsfeldes einseitig 
nur im Zuge bemerkbar, während doch die beiden Sätze gleichberechtigt 
sein sollen: Die Welt ruht und der Zug wird gebremst — der Zug ruht 
und die Welt wird gebremst? Die Antwort hierauf ist folgende: Der 
Kirchturm fällt nicht um, weil beim Bremsen seine relative Lage gegen 
die fernen, kosmischen Massen gar nicht geändert wird; der Ruck, den 
vom Zuge aus gesehen die ganze Welt erfährt, betrifft alle Körper bis 
zu den fernsten Gestirnen, einschließlich des Kirchturms, gleichmäßig, 
alle diese Körper fallen frei in dem während der Bremsung auftretenden 
Gravitationsfelde ausgenommen der Zug, der durch die bremsenden Kräfte 
am freien Fallen gehindert wird. Frei fallende Körper verhalten sich 
aber bezüglich innerer Vorgänge (wie es das Gleichgewicht des Kirch- 
turms auf der Erde ist) genau so wie frei schwebende, allen Einflüssen 
entzogene Körper; es treten also keinerlei Gleichgewichtsstörungen auf, 
der Kirchturm fällt nicht um. Der Zug dagegen wird am freien Fallen 
gehindert; dadurch entstehen Kräfte und Spannungen, die zu den zer- 
störenden Folgen führen. 

Die Berufung auf den »gesunden Menschenverstand« in diesen 
schwierigen Fragen ist überhaupt mißlich. Es gibt Anhänger der Theorie 
vom substantiellen Äther, die sich gegen die Relativitätstheorie wehren, 
weil sie ihnen nicht anschaulich, bildmäßig genug ist. Manche von 
diesen haben schließlich das spezielle Relativitätsprinzip anerkannt, nach- 
dem die Experimente eindeutig dafür entschieden haben; aber sie sträuben 
sich noch gegen das Prinzip von der allgemeinen Relativität, weil dieses 
ihrem gesunden Verstände zuwider sei. Diesen hat Einstein folgende 
Lehre erteilt: Nach der speziellen Relativitätstheorie ist jedenfalls der 
gleichförmig fahrende Zug ein mit der Erde gleichberechtigtes Bezug- 
system. Wird das der gesunde Verstand des Lokomotivführers zugeben? 
Er wird einwenden, daß er doch nicht die »Gegend« unausgesetzt heizen 
und schmieren müsse, sondern die Lokomotive, und daß es entsprechend 
die letztere sein müsse, in deren Bewegung sich die Wirkung seiner 
Arbeit zeige. Eine solche Anwendung des gesunden Menschenverstandes 
führt schließlich zur Negation aller wissenschaftlichen Betrachtung; denn 
wozu dient, so fragt der gesunde Verstand des Alltagsmenschen, die Be- 



Mechanische Folgerungen und Bestätigungen. 253 

schäftigimg mit Relativität oder Kathodenstrahlen, da diese Tätigkeit offen- 
bar wenig geeignet ist, Geld damit zu erwerben? 

Wir fahren jetzt in der Betrachtung der Himmelsmechanik vom Ein- 
steinschen Standpunkte fort und wenden uns zu den lokalen Gravitations- 
feldern, die sich infolge der Existenz der planetaren Massen über das 
kosmische Feld überlagern. 

Wir können über diese Untersuchungen Einsteins nur kurz referieren, 
da es sich dabei hauptsächlich um mathematische Folgerungen aus den 
Feldgleichungen handelt. 

Das einfachste Problem ist die Bestimmung der Bewegung eines Pla- 
neten um die Sonne. Dabei geht man am bequemsten von dem schon 
erwähnten Gaußschen Koordinatensysteme aus, in dem in der Gegend 
des Sonnensystems bei Abwesenheit der Sonne und des Planeten das 
metrische Feld euklidisch und kein Gravitationsfeld im gewöhnlichen Sinne 
vorhanden wäre; es ist dadurch charakterisiert, daß ohne Berücksichtigung 
der Sonnenwirkung die ^^j, . . . ^^4 ^^^ Werte (99), S. 247, hätten. Es 
kommt nun darauf an, die durch die Sonnenmasse bewirkten Abweichungen 
von diesen Werten zu bestimmen; dazu dienen die Einsteinschen Feld- 
gleichungen, und es zeigt sich, daß diese unter der Annahme einer kugel- 
symmetrischen Ausbreitung der Sonnenmasse und damit auch des Feldes 
ganz bestimmte, relativ einfache Ausdrücke für die g^^, •••^34 liefern. 
Sodann kann man die Planetenbahnen als geodätische Linie dieser Maß- 
bestimmung berechnen. Ihre Krümmung, die in der Newtonschen Theorie 
als Wirkung der Anziehungskraft betrachtet wird, erscheint in der Einstein- 
schen Theorie als Folge der Krümmung der raumzeitlichen Welt, deren 
geradeste Linien sie sind. 

Die Durchrechnung ergibt nun, daß die so bestimmten Planetenbahnen 
mit großer Annäherung dieselben sind wie die der Newtonschen Theorie. 
Dieses Ergebnis ist wunderbar, wenn man sich den ganz verschiedenen 
Standpunkt beider Lehren vor Augen hält: Bei Newton der erkenntnis- 
theoretisch unbefriedigende absolute Raum und eine ad hoc erfundene 
ablenkende Kraft mit der merkwürdigen Eigenschaft, daß sie der trägen 
Masse proportional ist — bei Einstein ein allgemeines, den Ansprüchen 
der Erkenntniskritik genügendes Prinzip ohne jede spezielle Hypothese. 
Wenn die Einsteinsche Theorie nichts weiter leisten würde, als die New- 
tonsche Mechanik dem allgemeinen Relativitätsprinzip zu unterwerfen, so 
würde sie doch jeder vorziehen, der in den Gesetzen der Natur die Har- 
monie der höchsten Einfachheit sucht. 

Aber die Einsteinsche Theorie leistet mehr. Sie enthält, wie schon 
gesagt, die Newtonschen Gesetze der Planetenbahnen nur näherungsweise; 
die exakten Gesetze sind ein wenig anders, und zwar wird der Unter- 
schied um so größer, je näher der Planet der Sonne ist. Nun haben wir 
schon bei der Besprechung der Newtonschen Himmelsmechanik (III, 4, S. 5 1), 
gesehen, daß diese gerade beim sonnennächsten Planeten, Merkur, ver- 



254 ^^^ allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

sagt; es bleibt eine unerklärte Perihelbewegung des Merkur von 43 Bogen - 
Sekunden pro Jahrhundert. Genau diesen Betrag aber fordert die Ein- 
steinsche Theorie; sie ist daher durch Leverriers Rechnungen bereits im 
voraus bestätigt. Dieses Resultat ist von außerordentHchem Gewichte; 
denn in die Einsteinsche Formel gehen keine neuen, willkürlichen Kon- 
stanten ein, die »Anomahe« des Merkur ist eine ebenso notwendige 
Folgerung aus der Theorie wie die Gültigkeit der Keplerschen Gesetze 
für die Sonnenfernen Planeten. 

10. Optische Folgerungen und Bestätigungen. 

Außer "diesen astronomischen Folgerungen hat man bisher nur einige 
optische Erscheinungen gefunden, die sich nicht wegen ihrer Kleinheit 
den Beobachtungen entziehen. 

Die eine ist die Rotverschiebung der Spektrallinien des Lichtes, das 
von Gestirnen mit großer Masse kommt. Auf deren Oberfläche herrscht 
ein sehr starkes Gravitationsfeld; dieses verändert die Maßbestimmung 
und bewirkt, daß eine bestimmte Uhr dort langsamer geht als auf der 
Ej:de, wo das Gravitationsfeld kleiner ist. Solche Uhren hat man 
aber in den Atomen und Molekeln leuchtender Gase vor sich; der 
Schwingungsmechanismus in diesen ist sicherlich derselbe, wo auch die 
Molekel sich befinde, die Schwingungsdauer ist also in solchen Bezug- 
systemen gleich, in denen dasselbe Gravitationsfeld, etwa das Feld Null, 
herrscht. 

Sei die Schwingungsdauer im feldfreien Raumgebiete 7", so ist s = icT 
die zugehörige invariante Entfernung der Weltpunkte, die zwei aufeinander- 
folgenden Umkehrpunkten der Schwingung entsprechen, relativ zu dem 
Bezugsystem, in dem das Atom ruht. In einem relativ beschleunigten 
Bezugsystem, in dem ein Gravitationsfeld herrscht, wird dasselbe s = icT 
durch die Formel (98) gegeben, wo x^y^ z die Lage des Atoms charakteri- 
sieren imd t die in diesem System gemessene Schwingungszeit ist. Wir 
können x ^=^y = z =■ o setzen, indem wir den Nullpunkt der räumlichen 
Koordinaten in das Atom legen; dann wird 

s = — c T = g^^t ^ 
also 



Nun ist nur im feldfreien Räume g^^ = — ^^ [s. Formel (99), S. 247), 
also t = T. Im Gravitationsfelde aber ist g^^ von — ^^ verschieden, 
etwa g^^ = — c^(i — y); also ist die Schwingungsdauer verändert, näm- 
lich gleich 



Optische Folgerungen und Bestätigungen. 255 

oder, wenn die Abweichung y klein ist, angenähert (s. die Anmerkung 
auf S. 164) 

(100) /=7^|i4-l_j. 

Das ist der Unterschied im Gange zweier Uhren, welche sich an zwei 
verschiedenen Orten befinden, für die der Unterschied des durch g^ 
gemessenen Gravitationsfeldes den relativen Betrag y hat. 

Ob y positiv oder negativ ist, kann man durch Betrachtung eines 
einfachen Falles erkennen, wo die Frage direkt mit Hilfe des Äquivalenz - 
prinzips beantwortet werden kann. Das gelingt fiir ein konstantes Gra- 
vitationsfeld, wie es unmittelbar an der Oberfläche eines Himmelskörpers 
herrscht. Die Wirkung eines solchen Feldes g kann ersetzt werden durch 
eine der Anziehung entgegen gerichtete Beschleunigung des Beobachters 
von derselben Größe g. Ist / der Abstand des Beobachters von der 
Oberfläche des Gestirns, so wird eine von dieser ausgehende Lichtwelle 

/ . . 

die Zeit / = — bis zu ihm gebrauchen und er wird die Welle so wahr- 
nehmen, als hätte er während dieser Zeit eine beschleunigte Bewegung 
nach außen mit der Beschleunigung g vollführt. Dann käme ihm beim 

gl 
Eintreffen der Lichtwelle die Geschwindigkeit v = gt ^ — in der Rich- 

c 

tung der Lichtbewegung zu, daher beobachtet er nach dem Dopplerschen 
Prinzipe [Formel (40), S. 97] die verkleinerte Schwingungszahl 



.' = .(.-^)=.(,_^); 



also hängt die im Gravitationsfelde beobachtete Schwingungsdauer f = —^ 
mit der im feldfireien Räume bestimmten T = — so zusammen : 

V 



t= T 

oder angenähert 

(loi) t=T(i+^y 

Diese Formel gibt allgemein den Gangunterschied zweier Uhren an, die 
sich in einem konstanten Gravitationsfelde g im Abstände / befinden. 

Im konstanten Gravitationsfelde ist demnach die in (100) auftretende 

2gl . . 

Größe y = — —^ also positiv. Die Schwingungsdauer, somit auch die 
c 

Wellenlänge, wird für eine gegen die Anziehung des Gravitationsfeldes 

anlaufende Lichtwelle durch das Feld vergrößert. Dieses Resultat kann 



256 Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 



man auf das von den Gestirnen kommende Licht übertragen ; die Größe y 
wird positiv sein. Daher erscheinen alle Spektrallinien der Gestirne ein 
wenig nach Rot verschoben. Obwohl dieser Effekt sehr klein ist, ist 
seine Existenz heute sowohl auf der Sonne als auch auf Fixsternen recht 
wahrscheinlich gemacht worden. 

Wir können an dieser Stelle eine Lücke ausfüllen, die wir früher 
(VI, 5, S. 193) gelassen haben, nämlich die vollständige Aufklärung des 
sogenannten »Uhrenparadoxons«. Wir hatten dort zwei Beobachter A 
und B angenommen, von denen der eine A in einem Inertialsystem (der 
speziellen Relativitätstheorie) ruht, während der andere B eine Reise 
macht. Bei der Rückkehr von B geht dann nach (76), S. 194, die Uhr von A 

gegen die von B vor um den Betrag — / wo t die gesamte Reisezeit, 

2 

gemessen im System A ist; diese Formel gilt allerdings niu: näherungs- 
weise, doch genügt sie für unsere Zwecke, wenn wir auch alle andern 
Rechnungen mit entsprechender Annäherung durchführen. 

Nun kann man auch B als ruhend ansehen; dann macht A eine 
Reise in der umgekehrten Richtung. Aber man darf natürlich nicht ein- 
fach schließen, daß nun die Uhr von B gegen die von A um denselben 
Betrag vorgehen muß, denn B ruht nicht in einem Inertialsystem, sondern 
erfährt Beschleunigungen. 

Vom Standpunkte der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie muß man viel- 
mehr darauf achten, daß bei dem Wechsel des Bezugsystems bestimmte 
Gravitationsfelder während der Beschleunigungszeiten eingeführt werden 
müssen. 

Bei der ersten Betrachtungsweise ruht A in einem Raumgebiete, wo 
euklidische Maßbestimmung herrscht und Gravitationsfelder fehlen; bei 
der zweiten Betrachtungsweise ruht B in einem Bezugsystem, in dem bei 
der Abreise, der Umkehr und der Rückkunft von A kurz dauernde Gravi- 
tationsfelder auftreten, in denen A frei fällt, während B durch äußere 
Kräfte festgehalten wird. Von diesen drei Gravitationsfeldern haben das 
erste und das letzte keinen Einfluß auf den relativen Gang der Uhren 
von A und B, da diese sich im Augenblicke der Abreise und der Rück- 
kunft am selben Orte befinden und ein Gangunterschied im Gravita- 
tionsfeld nach (loi) nur bei einem Ortsunterschiede / der Uhren auftritt. 
Wohl aber entsteht bei der Umkehr von A ein Gangunterschied. Ist r 
die Zeitdauer der Umkehr, während der, wenn B als ruhend gilt, ein 
Gravitationsfeld besteht, so geht die im Abstände / und im Felde ^be- 
findliche Uhr A gegen die Uhr von B vor, und zwar mit genügender 

Annäherung nach (10 1), S. 255, um -^r. Aber in den Zeiten der gleich- 
förmigen Bewegung von A^ auf die man das spezielle Relativitätsprinzip 
anwenden muß, geht umgekehrt die Uhr von A gegen die von B nach 



Optische Folgerungen und Bestätigungen. 257 

um —4. Also hat im ganzen bei der Rückkehr die Uhr von A gegen 



2 

die von B einen Vorsprmig von 

Wir behaupten nun, daß dieser Wert genau mit dem Resultat der ersten 
Betrachtungsweise, wo A als ruhend angesehen wurde, übereinstimmt, 

nämlich gleich — t^ ist. 

Denn da der bewegte Beobachter bei der Umkehr von der Geschwin- 
digkeit V zur Geschwindigkeit — v übergeht, so ist seine Geschwindig- 
keitsänderung im ganzen 2V\ seine Beschleunigung erhält man daraus 

. . 211 

durch Division mit der gebrauchten Zeit t, sie beträgt also g = — . 

Andrerseits ist im Augenblick der Umkehr die halbe Reisedauer t^ ver-

t 
Daraus folgt gl = v"^ -^ und

womit der Beweis erbracht ist. 

Das Uhrenparadoxon beruht also auf einer falschen Anwendung der 
speziellen Relativitätstheorie, wo in Wahrheit die allgemeine angewandt 
werden muß. 

Ein ganz ähnlicher Fehler liegt folgendem Einwände zugrunde, der 
immer wieder vorgebracht wird, so trivial auch die Aufklärung ist. 

Nach der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie soll ein gegen die Fixsterne 
rotierendes, also etwa ein mit der Erde fest verbundenes Koordinaten- 
system mit dem gegen die Fixsterne ruhenden System völlig gleich- 
berechtigt sein. In einem solchen System aber werden die Fixsterne 
selbst ungeheure Geschwindigkeiten bekommen; ist r die Entfernung eines 

2 7t T 

Sterns, so wird seine Geschwindigkeit v = — ^ ; wo T die Dauer eines 
Tages bedeutet. Diese wird gleich der Lichtgeschwindigkeit ^, wenn 
r = — ist; mißt man r in der astronomischen Längeneinheit Lichtjahr^), 

2 7t 

so muß man dies durch ^-365 dividieren, wenn T=i Tag gesetzt 

wird. Sobald also die Entfernung Lichtjahre übersteigt, wird 

2 7t • SOS

300000 km pro sec in einem Jahre (365 Tagen) zurücklegt.

258 Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 



die Geschwindigkeit größer als c. Aber schon die nächsten Fixsterne 
sind mehrere Lichtjahre von der Sonne entfernt. Andrerseits behauptet 
die Relativitätstheorie (VI, 6, S. 199), daß die Geschwindigkeit materieller 
Körper immer kleiner sein muß als die des Lichtes. Hier scheint ein 
Widerspruch zu klafifen. 

Dieser entsteht aber nur dadurch, daß der Satz v <^c ganz und gar 
auf die spezielle Relativitätstheorie beschränkt ist. In der allgemeinen 
nimmt er folgende enge Fassung an: Man kann bekanntlich immer ein 
solches Bezugsystem wählen, daß in der unmittelbaren Umgebung eines 
beliebigen Weltpunkts Minkowskis Weltgeometrie herrscht, also die Geo- 
metrie euklidisch ist, kein Gravitationsfeld besteht, die ^^^ , ...g die 
Werte (99), S. 247, haben; in Bezug auf dieses System und in diesem 
engen Räume ist die Lichtgeschwindigkeit c = 3 • io^° cm/sec die obere 
Schranke für alle Geschwindigkeiten. 

Sobald aber diese Bedingungen nicht erfüllt sind, also sobald Gra- 
vitationsfelder herrschen, kann natürlich jede Geschwindigkeit, sowohl die 
materieller Körper als auch die des Lichts, jeden numerischen Wert an- 
nehmen. Denn die Lichtlinien in der Welt sind bestimmt durch G = s"^ =^ o^ 
also bei Beschränkung auf die ^ /-Ebene durch 

X 

aus dieser quadratischen Gleichung läßt sich — berechnen, und das 
ist die Lichtgeschwindigkeit. Ist z. B. ^^^ = 0, so erhält man aus 

X ~\ / P" 

^„ a;'' + ^^4 /^ = o den Wert ~- = y —^-A± als Lichtgeschwindigkeit, 

der ganz davon abhängt, wie groß g^^ und g^^ gerade sind. 

Nimmt man die Erde als Bezugsystem, so existiert das Zentrifugal - 

feld (III, 9, S. 64) — ^^^— , das in großen Entfernungen ganz ungeheiure 

Werte annimmt; die g haben daher auch Werte, die von den euklidischen 
(99) sehr stark abweichen. Daher ist die Lichtgeschwindigkeit für manche 
Richtungen des Lichtstrahls viel größer als ihr gewöhnlicher Wert ^, und 
andere Körper können ebenfalls viel größere Geschwindigkeiten erreichen. 
In einem beliebigen Gaußschen Koordinatensystem wird nicht nur die 
Lichtgeschwindigkeit anders, sondern auch die Lichtstrahlen bleiben nicht 
gerade. Auf dieser Krümmung der Lichtstrahlen beruht eine zweite opti- 
sche Prüfung des allgemeinen Relativitätsprinzips. Die Weltlinien des 
Lichts sind ja geodätische Linien, genau so wie die Trägheitsbahnen 
materieller Körper, und werden daher in Gravitationsfeldern genau wie 
diese gekrümmt; nur ist die Lichtablenkung viel geringer wegen der 
ungeheuren Geschwindigkeit des Lichts. Man sieht diese Ablenkung 
ohne alle Theorie aus dem Äquivalenzprinzip ein; denn in einem beschleu- 
nigten Bezugsystem erscheint jede geradlinige und gleichförmige Bewegung

Ein Lichtstrahl, der, von einem Fixstern kommend, an der Sonne 
vorbeistreicht, wird daher von dieser angezogen und beschreibt eine nach 
der Sonne etwas konkave Bahn (Abb. 135); der Beobachter auf der Erde 
verlegt den Sternort in die Verlängerung des ihn treffenden Strahls, daher 
erscheint ihm der Stern nach außen abgelenkt. Man könnte diese Ab- 
lenkung auch nach der Newtonschen Attraktionstheorie berechnen, in dem 
man den Lichtstrahl etwa wie einen mit Lichtgeschwindigkeit heran- 
schießenden Kometen behandelt, und es ist historisch interessant, daß diese 
Überlegung schon im Jalire 1801 von dem deutschen Mathematiker und 
Geodäten Soldner angestellt .worden ist. Man erhält dann eine ähnliche 
Formel wie die Einsteinsche, sie liefert aber nur die Hälfte des Betrages 
der Ablenkung. Das liegt an der von der Einsteinschen Theorie ge- 
forderten Verstärkung des Gravitationsfeldes in der Nähe 
der Sonne. Gerade dieser geringfügig erscheinende Unter- 
schied, der übrigens Einstein selbst bei seiner ersten, vor- \ 
läufigen Publikation entgangen war, bildet also ein beson- \ 
ders scharfes Kriterium für die Richtigkeit der allgemeinen ^ 
Relativitätstheorie. ' 

Die Ablenkung der scheinbaren Stellungen der Fixsterne 
in der Nähe der Sonne ist nur während der kurzen Dauer 
einer totalen Sonnenfinsternis zu beobachten, da sonst die 
Strahlung der Sonne die in ihrer Nähe stehenden Fixsterne 
unsichtbar macht. 

Die letzte Sonnenfinsternis fand am 29. Mai 191 9 
statt; zu dieser haben die Engländer zwei Expeditionen 
ausgerüstet, die keine andere Aufgabe hatten, als festzu- 
stellen, ob der » EinsteinefFekt « wirklich vorhanden sei 
oder nicht. Die eine ging nach der Westküste von Afrika, 
die andere nach Nordbrasilien, und sie brachten eine Reihe 
von photographischen Aufnahmen der die Sonne umgeben- 
den Fixsterne mit. Das Resultat der Ausmessung der 
Platten konnte am 6. November 191 9 verkündet werden und 
bedeutete den Triumph der Einsteinschen Theorie: die von Einstein vor- 
hergesagte Verschiebung, die am Sonnenrande 1,7 Bogensekunden betragen 
soll, ist in vollem Betrage da. 

Seit dieser größten Leistung moderner Prophetie kann die Einsteinsche 
Lehre als gesicherter Besitz der Wissenschaft gelten. 

Die Frage, ob es möglich sein wird, noch andere beobachtbare Er- 
scheinungen zu finden, durch die die Theorie geprüft werden kann, läßt 
sich mit Sicherheit nicht beantworten; aber da wahrscheinlich die Beobach- 
tungskunst späterer Jahrzehnte oder Jahrhunderte die unsere um ebenso- 
viel übertreffen wird, wie diese die Leistungen der Newtonschen Zeit,

260 I^is allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 

SO darf man erwarten, daß die neue Theorie immer engeren Anschluß 
an die Erfahrung finden wird. 

II. Makrokosmos und Mikrokosmos. 

Wir haben oben gesehen, daß die konsequente Auffassung der Träg- 
heitskräfte als Wechselwirkungen notwendig dazu führt, die Theorie auf 
den ganzen Kosmos anzuwenden. Es handelt sich darum zu verstehen, 
warum dasjenige Bezugsystem, für das in der Gegend des Sonnensystems 
die euklidische Metrik gilt, gerade in relativer Ruhe (oder in Trans- 
lationsbewegung) zu der Gesamtheit der kosmischen Massen ist. Weiter 
aber lehrt die Beobachtung ferner Sternsysteme, Doppelsterne, das dort 
genau das gleiche gilt. Es scheint danach so zu sein, als wenn das durch 
die Gesamtheit aller Massen bestimmte metrische Feld überall den gleichen 
Charakter hat, es sei denn, daß dieser durch nahe Massen lokal gestört wird. 

Spekulationen über das Universum sind seit jeher ein Lieblingsthema 
phantasievoller Köpfe; aber auch die wissenschaftliche Astronomie hat 
sich mit solchen Problemen befaßt. Vor allem ist die Frage untersucht 
worden, ob es endlich viele oder unendlich viele Himmelskörper gibt, 
und man hat sich für das erstere entscheiden müssen; wir können die 
Begründung hier nur andeuten. Sind die Gestirne ziemlich gleichförmig 
im Räume verteilt und wäre ihre Anzahl unendlich groß, so müßte der 
ganze Himmel in hellem Lichte erstrahlen, weil dann schließhch in jeder 
Richtung irgendwo einmal ein Stern zu treffen wäre; es sei denn, daß 
das Licht auf seinem Wege vom Sterne zu uns geschwächt, verschluckt 
würde. Aber man kann mit guten Gründen belegen, daß es keine Absorp- 
tion des Lichtes im Weltenraume gibt. Daher muß man sich die Gesamt- 
heit aller Sterne als eine riesige Anhäufung denken, die entweder plötzlich 
nach außen aufhört oder sich wenigstens allmählich nach außen verdünnt. 

Aber diese Vorstellung führt zu einer großen Schwierigkeit, wenn man 
von der Newtonschen Mechanik ausgeht. Warum bleiben die Sterne bei- 
sammen? Warum verlieren sie sich nicht im Nichts? Man weiß, daß 
alle Sterne beträchtliche Geschwindigkeiten haben, aber diese sind un- 
regelmäßig nach allen Richtungen verteilt, man bemerkt keine Andeutung, 
daß das Ganze nach außen auseinanderstrebt. 

Man wird darauf antworten: Nun, die gegenseitige Gravitation hält 
die Sterne zusammen. 

Aber diese Antwort ist falsch. Man kennt seit langem die Methoden, 
um solche Probleme zu untersuchen. Es sind die Methoden der kine- 
tischen Gastheorie] ein Gas besteht aus unzähligen Molekeln, die wirr 
durcheinander fliegen, und man kennt die Gesetze dieser Bewegungen. 

Nun ist doch klar, daß ein Gas, das nicht in feste Wände ein- 
geschlossen ist, sofort auseinanderfliegt; Erfahrung und Theorie lehren 
übereinstimmend, daß ein System von Körpern nicht dauernd beisammen 



Makrokosmos und Mikrokosmos. 26 1 



bleibt, auch wenn die Körper sich mit Kräften anziehen, die nach dem 
Newtonschen Gesetze umgekehrt proportional dem Quadrate der Ent- 
fernung wirken. 

Das System aller Gestirne müßte sich genau so, wie ein Gas ver- 
halten, und es ist also nicht zu verstehen, warum es keinerlei Tendenz 
zeigt, sich im unendlichen Weltenraume zu verlieren. 

Einstein hat hierauf eine sehr merkwürdige Antwort: »weil die Welt 
gar nicht unendlich ist«. Ja, wo sollten aber ihre Grenzen sein? Ist es 
nicht absurd anzunehmen, die Welt sei irgendwo »mit Brettern ver- 
nagelt << ? 

Nun, begrenzt und endlich ist keineswegs dasselbe. Man denke an 
die Oberfläche einer Kugel; diese ist zweifellos endlich und doch ohne 
Grenzen. Einstein behauptet nun, daß der dreidimensionale Raum sich 
genau so verhalte; er darf dies, da ja die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie 
eine Krümmung des Raumes zuläßt. So kommt er zu folgender Theorie 
vom Universum: Sieht man von der ungleichförmigen Verteilung der Ge- 
stirne ab und ersetzt diese durch eine überall gleichförmige Massen- 
verteilung, so kann man fragen, wann eine solche nach den Feld- 
gleichungen der Gravitation dauernd in Ruhe verharren kann. Die Ant- 
wort lautet : das Krümmungsmaß des dreidimensionalen Räumet WklQ überall 
einen konstanten, positiven Wert haben, genau so wie das einer zwei- 
dimensionalen Kugelfläche. Es ist evident, daß auf einer Kugelfläche 
eine endliche Zahl von Massenpunkten, die durch ihre Geschwindigkeit 
auseinanderstreben, sich gleichförmig ausbreiten und eine Art dynamisches 
Gleichgewicht bilden. Genau das entsprechende soll also für die drei- 
dimensionale Verteilung der Gestirne gelten. Einstein schätzt sogar die 
Größe der »Weltkrümmung« mit Hilfe einer plausiblen Annahme über 
die gesamte Masse aller Gestirhe ab; leider ergibt sie sich so gering^), 
daß vorläufig keine Hofihung besteht, diese kühnen Gedanken empirisch 
zu prüfen. 

Daraus, daß die Weltkrümmung überall denselben Wert hat, folgt 
sodann, daß das metrische Feld überall in der Welt denselben Charakter 
hat und daß es euklidisch ist gerade in demjenigen Bezugsystem, das 
zur Gesamtheit aller Massen ruht (oder sich geradlinig gleichförmig da- 
gegen bewegt). Dieser Satz enthält den Kern der Tatsachen, die Newton 
durch seine Lehre vom absoluten Räume darstellen wollte. 

Jeder Versuch, sich eine solche endhche, aber unbegrenzte » sphärische « 
Welt vorzustellen^ ist natürlich hoffnungslos, geradeso unmöglich, wie der, 
eine Anschauung von den lokalen Weltkrümmungen in der Nähe gravi- 
tierender Massen zu gewinnen. Und doch hat diese Theorie sehr kon- 
krete Folgen. Man denke sich ein Fernrohr in der Babelsberger Stern- 

^) Nach einer Schätzung von de Sitter ist der >Umfang der Welt«, d. h. die Länge 
einer in sich zurücklaufenden geodätischen Weltlinie, etwa 100 Millionen Lichtjahre. 



2(i2 Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie Einsteins. 



warte nach einem bestimmten Fixstern gerichtet; zu gleicher Zeit soll 
bei den Antipoden, also etwa in Sidney in Australien, ein Fernrohr auf 
genau die gegenüberliegende Stelle des Himmels gerichtet sein. Dann 
ist es nach der Einsteinschen Kosmologie denkbar, daß die Beobachter 
an beiden Fernrohren ei/i und denselben Stern sehen, der etwa durch ein 
charakteristisches Spektrum kennthch ist! In der Tat, genau wie jemand 
eine Reise um die Erde sowohl nach Osten als nach Westen antreten 
und auf demselben größten Kreise in beiden Richtungen herumfahren kann, 
so wird ein Lichtstrahl in der sphärischen Welt Einsteins auf einer 
geodätischen Linie nach beiden Richtungen vom Gestirn ausgehen und 
die Erde in entgegengesetzten Richtungen treffen können. 

Heute mag man solche Betrachtungen noch Ausgeburten einer wilden 
Phantasie nennen; wer weiß, ob sie nicht in wenigen Jahrhunderten durch 
die verfeinerte Beobachtungskunst empirische Tatsachen werden? Es wäre 
vermessen, diese Möglichkeit zu leugnen. Schon heute ^ibt es ernsthafte 
Astronomen, die bei ihren exakten Untersuchungen über die Gesetze der 
Verteilung der Fixsterne Einsteins Lehre vom Makrokos??ios zugrunde legen. 

Aber auch in den Mikrokosmos, die Welt der Atome, greifen Ein- 
steins Gedanken ein. Wir haben schon früher (V, 15, S. 169) die Frage 
nach den merkwürdigen Klräften gestreift, die verhindern, daß ein Elektron 
oder ein Atom auseinanderfliegt. Nun sind diese Gebilde ungeheure An- 
häufungen von Energie auf kleinsten Räumen; daher werden sie gewaltige 
Raumkrümmungen oder, mit andern Worten, Gravitationsfelder in sich 
bergen. Der Gedanke liegt nahe, daß diese es sind, die die auseinander- 
strebenden elektrischen Ladungen zusammenhalten. 

Aber diese Theorie ist erst in den Anfängen und es ist dturchaus 
ungewiß, ob ihr ein Erfolg beschieden sein wird. Wissen wir doch aus 
zahlreichen Erfahrungen, daß in der atomistischen Welt neue, fremdartige 
Gesetze herrschen, in denen eine uns noch unvollkommen verständliche 
Harmonie ganzer Zahlen zum Ausdruck kommt: die sogenannte Quanten- 
theorie von Planck (1900). Hier hat die zukünftige Forschung das Wort. 

12. Schluß. 

Wir kennen nun, wenn auch nur in rohen Zügen, die Einsteinschen 
Lehren von Raum und Zeit. Wir haben ihre Entstehung aus den physi- 
kalischen Theorien seiner Vorgänger verfolgt und dabei gesehen, wie ein 
deutlich erkennbarer Prozeß der Objektivierung und Relativierung durch 
die verschlungenen Wege der Forschung zu der Höhe der Abstraktion 
führt, die die Grundbegrifte der exakten Naturwissenschaften heute aus- 
zeichnet. Die Kraft der neuen Lehre beruht auf ihrer unmittelbaren 
Herkunft von der Erfahrung; sie ist eine Tochter des Experiments und 
hat selbst neue Experimente geboren, die von ihr Zeugnis ablegen. Aber 
das, was ihre Bedeutung über das enge Reich der Spezialforschung hin- 



Schluß. 263 

aus ausmacht, ist die Größe, Kühnheit und Geradheit der Gedanken. 
Einsteins Theorie repräsentiert eine Geistesrichtung, die das gesunde 
Gleichmaß zwischen frei schaffender Phantasie, kritischer Logik und ge- 
duldiger Anpassung an die Tatsachen zum Ideal hat. Sie ist keine Welt- 
anschauung, wenn Welt mehr bedeutet als Minkowskis raumzeitliche 
Mannigfaltigkeit; aber sie führt den, der sich in ihre Gedanken liebevoll 
versenkt, zu einer Weltanschauung. Denn auch außerhalb der Wissen- 
schaft ist die objektive und relative Betrachtung ein Gewinn, eine Er- 
lösung von Vorurteilen, eine Befreiung des Lebens von Normen, deren 
Anspruch auf absolute Geltung vor dem kritischen Urteil des Relativisten 
dahinschmilzt.
